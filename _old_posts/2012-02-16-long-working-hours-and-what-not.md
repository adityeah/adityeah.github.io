I&#8217;ve been going through a stressed out time in my life, more stressful than usual and one of the things that generally bears the brunt during times like these is my blog. 

I&#8217;m intending to be back soon but the frequency of my posts may drastically vary. These stressed out times have been around for sometime and the good thing is that though I may not be updating this blog often, I have managed to spend time writing. In fact, as I posted earlier, Caravan has published me and another post I wrote a few months back (How do you support Mr.Hazare? Link [here](http://www.adityeah.com/2011/11/10/how-do-you-support-mr-hazare/)) was published by Bangalore&#8217;s DNA. 

As I have found out lately, a lot of energy goes in a story that makes it to print. But there are less things in life that give me a high than what I get when I see my writing in ink.
