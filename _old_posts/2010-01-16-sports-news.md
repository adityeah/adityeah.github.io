No excuses for a month long hiatus but lots of things happening with Sports:

India&#8217;s Hockey team goes on a &#8216;strike&#8217; because they are not paid their dues by Hockey India. This is how we treat those who are the best players of our National game. 

And then, India&#8217;s first individual Olympic Gold Medalist [says](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/shooting/Angry-Abhinav-Bindra-wants-to-quit-shooting/articleshow/5451647.cms) he wants to quit the game because of, none other than, the National Shooting Federation.

Is this because of our obsession with Cricket? If you ask me, I don&#8217;t think so. You can&#8217;t blame Cricket for the mismanagement and apathy towards other sports shown by Government Sports bodies.

In tennis, Sania Mirza would be [quitting](http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sania-to-quit-tennis-after-marriage/H1-Article1-497350.aspx) tennis soon. No, she is not unhappy with All India Tennis Association, as you may be guessing by now but she thinks it would be the right thing to do after marriage.

Meanwhile, The Big daddy of Marathi Manoos Inc, has [issued](http://news.rediff.com/report/2010/jan/13/wont-allow-aus-team-to-play-in-maharashtra-says-thackeray.htm) a latest threat &#8212; Australian cricketers won&#8217;t be allowed to play in Maharashtra. How can they be allowed to play here when in Australia, Indians are being stabbed on an almost daily basis? Very considerate about Indians. What happened to this nationalism when his party &#8216;workers&#8217; thrashed non-marathis on a regular basis?

So much for the sports. 

**Update:** An updated version of the last para above has appeared in today&#8217;s edition of DNA in Bangalore. It made its way as a &#8220;Letter to the Editor&#8221; and talks about Indian Politicians approving of Violence, among a few other related topics.
