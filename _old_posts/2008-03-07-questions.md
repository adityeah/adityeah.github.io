**Update**  
A whole lot of discussion going on at DC and I am thankful it hasn&#8217;t got into personal feuds just yet. But some sentiments for sure. Worth a dekko, the whole thing [here](http://desicritics.org/2008/03/07/011729.php).

Questions for Raj Thackeray:

1. Are you specifically against _UP-wallahs_ and _Biharis_ because, as you allege, they spread &#8220;filth&#8221;?

2. Or do North-Indians in general, spread filth?

3. If any of the above is true, can we assume that you have no problems with South-Indians? Does it mean that you are okay with South Indians coming to Mumbai?

4. When you say that outsiders being a menace to Mumbai, what exactly do you mean? If a Maharashtrian living in Nashik comes to Mumbai to earn a living, would he qualify to be called an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and in effect, spread &#8220;filth&#8221;?

5. Or could it be that a Maharashtrian living elsewhere in Maharashtra is a lesser &#8220;outsider&#8221; than a person who has crossed several states to come to Mumbai? Doesn&#8217;t it then look like a matter of convenience?

6. And what about a Maharashtrian who has lived all his life in Patna and decides to come to Mumbai for a living? Is he an outsider too? Would he be a problem?

7. Lastly, what about me, Sir? I have lived almost 10 years in Maharashtra. I love eating pooran poli and I understand Marathi. I am not that good when it comes to speaking Marathi but compared to Punjabi, which happens to be my mother tongue, I find Marathi more comfortable. Oh and yes, I was born in New Delhi to a Punjabi family. Can I come back to Mumbai? Or will you throw me out since I do not have a Maharashtrian Surname?
