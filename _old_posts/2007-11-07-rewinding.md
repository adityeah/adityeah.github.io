There was a time, in this very house in Goa, I used to listen to my walkman when the power used to go off. The &#8220;power-going-off&#8221; apparently, happens rather usually here. And when its a dark and gloomy evening like what it is now, there was no question of electricity. So, in those days not so long back, I used to take out the tapes from my travel luggage that I used to carry along from Indore. In a way it was funny because I always thought that my walkman would not be of use while I&#8217;d be at home in Goa. We had an audio CD player at home and walkman was for students who used to travel in second class coaches in trains and spend their lives in a single room, studying for nights, while during college days.  
  
So the U2s and the Robbie Williams used to come out and since there was no power, saving the power contained in those batteries added to the objective, even if it meant pushing the end of a Reynold&#8217;s 045 Fine Carbure pen into one of the tape&#8217;s reels and rotate it endlessly, one way or the other, depending on what you wanted to do &#8212; Rewind or Fast Forward.  
  
6 years later, nothing much has changed. I don&#8217;t do that tape thing anymore. But I do open up my IBM Thinkpad, connect it to my nokia mobile phone, download my email, write on my blog and download a podcast. The power is still not there and its raining heavily outside. It never rains in Goa in November, let alone a day before Deepawali.  
  
This could be the Monsoon&#8217;s swan song but it has reminded me of the many days that I have spent here, rewinding the tape with a Reynold&#8217;s pen.
