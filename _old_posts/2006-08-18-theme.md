Switched to this new theme, [&#8220;the journalist&#8221;](http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/2-columns/837/the-journalist-10/). I love this plain, simple theme.  
  
The previous one ([Sajiv](http://sajiv.blogsome.com/), you asked for this) was a two column version of the style, [&#8220;Dots&#8221;](http://www.alexking.org/software/wordpress/styles/sample.php?wpstyle=dots). It was customised heavily. Feel free to ask me for it.  
  
But if you ask my opinion, I still think [&#8220;journalised sand&#8221;](http://managedtasks.com/wpthemes/blog/index.php?wptheme=Journalized+Sand) is one of the best WordPress themes ever, if you like the three column layout that is.
