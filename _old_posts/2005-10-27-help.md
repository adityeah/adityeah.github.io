Yesterday was Blog Quake Day. I have been off blogosphere for the past few days and I missed. But it&#8217;s never too late to do a right thing.  
  
My request to fellow bloggers is to link and tell about the [earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Kashmir_earthquake) and the relief operations. Do every little thing that you can. Link to the sites, spread word, request for donations, anything that you think can help in any way. Mind you, this is much worse than the Tsunami that happened last year.  
  
DesiPundits page on the [quake](http://www.desipundit.com/2005/10/22/blog-quake-day/#more-1431). Uma&#8217;s latest [post](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2005/10/it-must-be-clear-to-everybody.html#comments) on this. Sujatha&#8217;s effort [here](http://blogpourri.blogspot.com/2005/10/earthquake-relief-time-is-running-out.html).  
  
Online donations [here](http://www.saquake.org/online_donations/index.html). United Nation&#8217;s [appeal](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_28933.html).
