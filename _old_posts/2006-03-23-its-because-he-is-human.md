Excerpts from this very touching article at Cricinfo. The link is all over it:

> [Tendulkar looked briefly like he was on the road to redemption. He wasn&#8217;t supposed to get out to a 37-year-old, balding off-spinner, nicknamed Shaggy, with a Test bowling average of 92.](http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indveng/content/current/story/241662.html)

And some more:  


> This series has changed all that. Tendulkar has been human. And to the followers of English cricket, pretty much for the first time.  
>  
> Tendulkar, caught Bell, bowled Udal. Who would have thought? But there it is, in the scorebook. Forever.
