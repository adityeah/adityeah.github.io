Coming back from an unintended hibernation, I am surprised how non-reactive I have been to issues like (among other things) recession, Varun Gandhi (well not really), 80 year old chaps contesting elections, the heat waves across the country, the annual cricket tournament which lets you turn on the tv and put it on mute because you just cant afford cricket every single day for a month.

So here I am, making a very silent comeback while I also try to know how much of you missed me. Name the two movies these quotes come from. Even cheating would do, I am just interested to know who makes it reading here and cares enough to comment. 

Also, I keep the right to post anonymous comments here to save embarrassment. 

Quote #1 &#8211; 

> &#8220;There has to be a mathematical explanation for how bad that tie is. &#8221; 

Quote #2 &#8211; 

> Character 1: It&#8217;s finding the center of your story, the beating heart of it, that&#8217;s what makes a reporter. You have to start by making up some headlines. You know: short, punchy, dramatic headlines. Now, have a look, what do you see?  
> [Points at dark clouds at the horizon]&#8230; Tell me the headline.  
> Character 2: Horizon Fills With Dark Clouds?  
> Character 1: Imminent Storm Threatens Village.  
> Character 2: But what if no storm comes?  
> Character 1: Village Spared From Deadly Storm.
