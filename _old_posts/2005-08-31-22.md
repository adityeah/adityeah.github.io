The machines that interest me do not work on land. They work in either the Sea or the Sky.

I have been collecting warplane models for some time. Recently an &#8220;aviation&#8221; store has also opened near my office, making money matters worse for me since the last time I got my salary, it was my first destination. Anyway, here are the pictures of my fleet. These models stand on my desk.

Above: The Messerschmitt 109-G, also known as &#8220;Gustav&#8221;, an example of magnificent design of the German Airpower. Played a major role for Germany in the battles against Britain during WWII.

Above: The B-24 &#8220;Liberator&#8221; of the USAF, could be easily called the &#8220;mother of all bombers&#8221; was in service till 1944. 4 Engines and a top speed of 450 kmph.

Above: The AV-8B Harrier II- A part of the modern fleet. One of the best Aircrafts a navy could ever have. It&#8217;s unique ability to take-off/land vertically using the VTOL and the STOL ability using the Ski Jump is a big advantage, besides having a top speed of 1100 KMPH. Originally a Royal Navy product- a previous version of this, the Sea Harrier, is now also maintained by the Indian Navy. I had the opportunity to take a good look at its cockpit while my visit to the Indian Navy vessel, INS Viraat (prev. [HMS Hermes](http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/HMS-Hermes-%28R12%29) of The Royal Navy) some years back. By the way, INS Viraat can accommodate upto 30 of these. 

Soon I will be publishing pictures taken of real aircrafts.
