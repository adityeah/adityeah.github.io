The Sunday Times of India, page 14 &#8220;Spotlight | Instant IQ&#8221;, a feature called &#8220;Guru Gyaan&#8221; has the heading &#8220;About a Boy&#8221; and talks about one Kurt Cobain. Everything fine except for the fact that it has been copied, verbatim, from Wikipedia&#8217;s page about, no prizes for guessing, Kurt Cobain.  
  
Wikipedia&#8217;s page on Kurt Cobain [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain).  
  
It&#8217;s copied as is. TOI has not even attempted to get away with it. Over the years, this newspaper has been caught plagiarizing so many times and yet it does not change anything at the editorial desks of the daily. This surprises me. Whats even more appalling is that **this is happening at the national level**, not in city supplements. At least the Kolkata, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and the Mumbai editions carry it.  
  
Another thing: The article has a line saying, &#8220;Cobain struggled with drug addiction and the media pressures surrounding him and his wife Courtney Love&#8221;.  
  
This, under the heading, &#8220;What makes him cool?&#8221;. Wow, now this is something so &#8220;cool&#8221;.
