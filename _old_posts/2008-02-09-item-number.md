In a fast food chain restaurant, standing in a queue, overheard a couple of 30-something software engineers (or the likes) deciding on the menu. A sentence should suffice &#8212;

> &#8220;_yeh le le_ &#8212; this combo has 4 items compared to that one, which has only 3 items, for the same price&#8221;. 

This sums up, how an Indian mind works once confronted with the menu.
