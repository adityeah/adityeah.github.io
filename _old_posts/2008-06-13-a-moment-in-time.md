I see this guy, has this Johnny Depp kind of a beard and a physique that could make the strictest of gym goers wonder what could be wrong with their workout regimen. Only later do I realize, because of his continued conversations on the phone, that he is a Muslim. He is called Aslam.  


> So we rode down to the river where the Victorian ghosts pray  
> For the curses to be broken  
> We go underneath the arches where the witches are and they say  
> There are ghost towns in the ocean  
> The ocean&#8230;

He is not a strict Muslim, that much I can see. For he does not do his prayers on the floor but on the train seat itself, with a pillow on his lap. And it is at that moment that the words are spoken to me, the sound in my head &#8212;  


> Gunners in the houses and gunners in my head  
> And all the cemeteries in London  
> I see god come in my garden but I donâ€™t know what he said  
> For my heart it wasnâ€™t open  
> Not open&#8230; 



Suddenly it&#8217;s all very clear. That very moment, those few seconds, I cease to see him as Aslam. Instead, I start seeing him as a misunderstood Muslim. And perhaps more importantly, a Muslim that has misunderstood it all. I have not come across many defining moments in my life but I sure know how it is when one happens.  
  
A few days back I read it somewhere and I think it was Bono who said &#8212; &#8220;Generally, religion gets in the way of God.&#8221; I know _exactly_ what Bono meant when he said that. Certainly, this is not about U2 or Coldplay&#8217;s latest or Aslam. It&#8217;s about identities lost, perceptions &#8212; both right and wrong, failures to connect with each other at the human level and a broken hotline with God, to top it all.  
  
Suddenly, it&#8217;s all very clear to me.
