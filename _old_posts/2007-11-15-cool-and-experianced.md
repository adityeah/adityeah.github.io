&#8220;MYSELF [name here]. I HAVE AN EXPERIANCE IN LECTURER&#8221;  
  
&#8220;IM COOL GIRL BUT VERY SENSITIVE BY NATURE. I DONT LIKE THE SHORT TEMPERED PERSONS.&#8221;  
  
These are actual matrimonial advertisements, quoted verbatim. With these coming my way, It would be a good ten or twenty years before I settle down in life. Of course, needless to say, I find myself in this situation since I have failed to find someone for myself but thats another story.  
  
Then, this latest one:  
  
&#8220;he should be smart&#8230; intelligent!! Looks don&#8217;t matter much but he should appreciate me&#8221;  
  
A closer look at her profile &#8212; Hobbies- Will tell you later; Interests &#8211; Will tell you later; Favorite Reads &#8211; Will tell you later and also, we would be knowing &#8220;later&#8221; about her favorite music too. No other information whatsoever, in fact, I am surprised and thankful that she made it clear that she wants someone who appreciates her.  
  
I shudder to think how casual one can be while looking out for the right person to get married to. If only one could get away from situations like these at will.  
  
THE COOL GALS and EXPERIANCED IN LECTURERS, never mind the spelling, time to bring them on&#8230;
