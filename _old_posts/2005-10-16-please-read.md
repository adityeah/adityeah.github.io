I dug up this from the [rediff.com](www.rediff.com) archives.  
  
In a link that I will soon reveal, Amitava Kumar, in a column written in 1999, asserts that most Indian writers in English, are reporters to the west.  
  
Barring Arundhati Roy, of course.  
  
Now, I hope that you have read Arundhati Roy&#8217;s essay &#8220;The End of Imagination&#8221;.  
  
An excerpt:  


> The jeering, hooting young men who battered down the Babri Masjid are the same ones whose pictures appeared in the papers in the days that followed the nuclear tests. They were on the streets, celebrating India&#8217;s nuclear bomb and simultaneously &#8220;condemning Western Culture&#8221; by emptying crates of Coke and Pepsi into public drains. I&#8217;m a little baffled by their logic: Coke is Western Culture, but the nuclear bomb is an old Indian tradition? 

It is not anything else that I wish you read but [this](http://www.zmag.org/southasia/endofimagination.htm). Please take some time out and read it if you still haven&#8217;t. See for yourself, what you missed for 7 years.  
  
And [here](http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/aug/30us.htm), Amitava Kumar praises Roy&#8217;s stance and is also &#8220;slightly&#8221; critical of her.  


If you shall need more matter on this subject, and something less emotional than Roy, please read about this book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/8175300256/qid=1129753353/sr=8-1/ref=sr\_8\_xs\_ap\_i1_xgl14/103-7610218-6506252?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">here</a>.
