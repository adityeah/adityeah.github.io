> &#8220;You know, people think I bought this big house (because) I wanted to live in a big house. But the idea is I am from Delhi and everybody lives in big bungalows there. For a Delhi-ite it&#8217;s not a big house even though I am a middle class boy.&#8221;

Shahrukh Khan says it [here](http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/feb/15sd1.htm).

Now, I find this strange, coming from SRK. Especially that part of the quote where he says that everybody in Delhi lives in &#8220;big bungalows&#8221;. I lived in Delhi for a good 7 years and now I realise that I was living in a bungalow. Wow.

Err&#8230;so he lives in a bungalow because he is from Delhi? And he is a middle class boy who lives in a bungalow that is not a big house?

Throughout [this](http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/feb/15sd1.htm) interview, SRK lays importance on the point how middle class his family is. This is nothing new, because I have never come across any Indian celebrity interview where they say that they belong to the upper-class. Or rather, don&#8217;t say that they are middle-class. 

I sincerely respect SRK for his humble beginnings, his continued rise to stardom, his acting in Swades and most of all, his work ethics. But this? Strange.
