The middle-class man movie maker is no more with us. Growing up on his brand of movies, I try to find the everyday middle class man in movies of today but I can&#8217;t.

It was the 1970s, the golden age of Indian Cinema that made movies for the society. Amol Palekar, wearing a tailor made full sleeve shirt with similar trousers, taking a walk on marine drive of Bombay and having peanuts was the hero of yesterday. But he looked more like me, for I don&#8217;t look like the Khans wearing Tommy Hilfiger shirts and driving imported cars. Thats what the hero of today does. 

That is why, [Hrishikesh Mukherjee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611531/), the man who gave us the _seedha-saadha_ Amol Palekar in Golmaal, the funny Dharmendra in Chupke Chupke, the confused, egoist Amitabh in Abhimaan and the funny, yet simply philosophical Rajesh Khanna in Bawarchi, will be missed.

&#8230;And who says KANK is a hit? None of the people I know have liked it so far. People are [coming out of the cinema hall halfway](http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Kabhi_Alvida_Na_Kehna-107035-1.html) through the movie. You call that a hit?
