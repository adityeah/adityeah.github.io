Yesterday I received my second credit card, a Citibank-CRY card it was.  
  
&#8220;Was&#8221;, because I lost it in less than 30 minutes.  
  
Now, I am not defending myself here but I have a pretty impressive record of keeping track of my plastic money as well as the &#8216;plastic&#8217; involved in it. I am surprised but it was sloppy of me. In fact it was one of the most careless acts I have ever come across. Certainly in the all-time top-5 acts of negligence.  
  
**How Ironical**, that a few hours before this happened, I had started programming a component of credit card software. Sigh.
