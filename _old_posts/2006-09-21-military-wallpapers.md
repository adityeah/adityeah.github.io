Here, I show you some of the best pictures of military aviation that I have gathered for some time. The sources have been numerous. I know there is a lot of stuff like this already available on the internet but the pictures below are my personal choice.  
  
These are links, meaning clicking on them would lead you to my flickr album where you can download the bigger pictures and if you want, can use on your desktop :)
