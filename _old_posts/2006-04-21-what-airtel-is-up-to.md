I have a friend who has been on the lookout for a boradband Internet connection at home. He stays in the _posh_ Koramangala section of the city. Since my experience with Airtel Broadband had been satisfactory, I suggested him to go for it.  
  
On his behalf, I started corresponding with this person from Airtel who was supposed to take care of the &#8220;prospective customers&#8221; in the Koramangala Area.  
  
After I sent the request, I was told a &#8220;Feasibility study&#8221; would be conducted. A few days and a few emails later, I had the &#8220;result&#8221; of their feasibility study in my inbox. That I could not understand most of their official/telecom lingo was another matter altogether.  
  
When I read the excel sheet which contained their analysis, I had this overall idea that something was wrong and they were not too eager to let me have the connection. Why would that happen? Airtel _does_ exist in Koramangala, it&#8217;s the hotspot of the city.  
  
I had misunderstood maybe. So I let the Airtel person tell it to me. Well, the &#8220;sub-pillar&#8221; was &#8220;choked&#8221; he told me on email. It meant they had a lot of customers in Koramangala. So many that they could not handle. And then came the bomb: We would request you to go to another Internet provider.  
  
There, I thought. Now, thats provoking. You&#8217;ve just given me the ticket to go to your bosses up there, lad. They ought to know, someone down there is _actually_ shooing people away. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;d be famous on my blog too.  
  
So this is the email, I had the pleasure of writing.  


> A few days back I had an email correspondence with one of your \***\**** managers. I had asked him for a connection in Koramangala, Bangalore. After some days, he had told me about a feasibility report which said that the &#8220;Sub-pillar&#8221; was choked and also suggested me to go to any other service provider.

> As per your advice, I have gone ahead and taken a connection from another service provider, which happens to be Airtel&#8217;s competitor in the market. They were more than ready to accept me as a customer.

Of course, it&#8217;s my friend who has gone to another service provider. Me, I have been off-Airtel for the past so many months now. That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t provide service in this part of the city. But even if they did, would they provide me a connection? I doubt it.
