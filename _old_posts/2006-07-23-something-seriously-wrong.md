There is something seriously wrong with rediff.com. It&#8217;s not the new look that I am talking about.  
  
I had noticed, a few days ago, how some of the articles now seem to stay longer on the homepage. For example, [this](http://in.rediff.com/getahead/2006/jul/19gadget.htm) article on home theatre systems first appeared 4 days back and is still on the homepage.  
  
Another, and this one really got me thinking, example is that many articles that have appeared before are not being &#8216;re-published&#8217;. Two of those articles, [this](http://in.rediff.com/getahead/2006/jun/26love.htm) (first published June 2006) and [this](http://in.rediff.com/getahead/2005/jul/25rashmi.htm) (first published July 2005), are currently bracing the rediff homepage.  
  
I am wondering, is rediff out of quality writers?
