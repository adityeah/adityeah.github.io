[Barcamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp) is an event held globally for techie people to join in, talk technology and come up with interesting ideas. Barcamps usually happen at the city level and Barcamp Bangalore, Bangalore&#8217;s first ever, is scheduled to be held at [Yahoo! Bangalore](http://bangalore.yahoo.com/), on the 22nd of April.  
  
India&#8217;s first Barcamp was held in Delhi on the 4th of March. (Many claim that they &#8216;beat&#8217; Bangalore to it. Well, I just like to think that Barcamp is not a competition.) In fact, I think Delhi&#8217;s Barcamp was the first in Asia. (Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong)  
  
The whole idea of an event like this is very interesting. I feel techies usually have some very interesting ideas inside their minds but the channels to let them out are absent. Those ideas die in the usual 10-to-8 job, add to it, the laziness inherited by each one of us. A conference (they actually prefer to call it _un_conference) like this could be the perfect launching pad for those ideas that could die a slow death inside a lazy geek&#8217;s brain.  
  
Another thing that impresses me about Barcamp is that everyone needs to contribute and play a part in the event. One could help organizing it, help by giving a presentation, help someone else who is giving a presentation or could just help arranging for beer. Just can&#8217;t be a pure spectator. Everyone is a participant in his/her own way.  
  
Though the event is open for anyone and everyone, the seats are limited and are available at first-come-first-serve basis. Bangalore&#8217;s Barcamp has a capacity for 100 campers and as expected, it&#8217;s all full. (I am camper #39 :)  
  
Of course, I will be covering the event, making notes and posting them here :)
