I feel for Bombay. No, let me call it Bombay, for once. It is this same city that I have felt for, in the prose of Rushdie, Mistry and Suketu Mehta. It is this city, Pankaj kapoor called his _mehbooba_, so aptly, in the movie [Maqbool](http://imdb.com/title/tt0379370/).  
  
I have sailed the rough waters of Bombay, I have travelled in the trains, those which were ripped apart yesterday.  
  
And they have done _this_ to it.  
  
Via [Uma&#8217;s blog](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2006/07/where-we-live.html), I came across a very simple but moving poem this morning. I wish to post it here. Along with that, my own poem, titled &#8220;Red&#8221;, I had written back in 2001 on one lonely night in Pune, after the 9/11 attacks.

    &#8220;The Tibetan in Mumbai&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Tibetan in Mumbai<br /> Abuses in Bambaiya Hindi,<br /> With a slight Tibetan accent<br /> And during vocabulary emergencies<br /> he naturally runs into Tibetan,<br /> That&#8217;s when the parsis laugh.<br /> The Tibetan in Mumbai<br /> Likes to flip through the MID-DAY<br /> Loves FM, but doesn&#8217;t expect<br /> A Tibetan song.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He catches a bus at a signal,<br /> Jumps into a running train,<br /> Walks into a long dark gully<br /> And nestles in his kholi.<br /> He gets angry<br /> When they laugh at him<br /> &#8216;ching-chong-ping-pong&#8217;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Tibetan in Mumbai<br /> Is now tired &#8230;<br /> Wants some sleep and a dream,<br /> On the 11p.m.Virar fast<br /> He goes to the Himalayas,<br /> The 8.05 a.m. fast local<br /> Brings him back to Churchgate<br /> Into the Metro: a New Empire.

  <p>
    So who&#8217;s to blame,<br /> for all this mess.<br /> The anger and the sorrow<br /> in the daily press.<br /> Those individuals who decide<br /> our fear for the airplane<br /> and the intensity of our pain<br /> or the politicians killing people<br /> and going insane.<br /> Theres blood on the radio,<br /> reporters working overtime,<br /> people watching red screens,<br /> bomb blasts for primetime.<br /> But what I am to say?<br /> what am I to do?<br /> Because these bombers and jets,<br /> they will come and go,<br /> while this heat<br /> will be left to overflow.
