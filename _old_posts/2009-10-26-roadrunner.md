Fellow blogger Dilip D&#8217;Souza&#8217;s third book is coming out in a few weeks from now. It is called, &#8220;Roadrunner: An Indian Quest in America&#8221;. Dilip blogs about it, [here](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/2009/10/roadrunner.html).

The book is a result of his road trips in America. Some of his writing from those trips made way to his blog and I have read most of them, over the years. I always felt that he sees America the same way as U2&#8217;s Bono does &#8212; You know, not the kind of America that bombs Iraq but the kind of America that says, &#8220;Hey, that moon is a beautiful thing &#8212; lets go there, take a walk on it&#8221;. 

Because America is amusing and at times, even misunderstood. Because America is much more than Bush, Obama, CNN and Hollywood. It is in those posts that Dilip&#8217;s insight unveils a face of America that needs to be discovered more. Suddenly, America is fascinating.

And it is exactly the reason I am looking forward to this book.
