Here&#8217;s one little fact that I am glad to be a part of: Bon Jovi and I have something in common.

On Friday, 30th of April, I took a flight (and then a connecting flight) from Bangalore to Newark, USA. I am glad to let my friends here know that I am on my first overseas job assignment, here in New Jersey, USA. It has been a very happening week, a lot of surprises and new things to look forward to and finally, I am making myself at home, here in the town of Sayreville, in the state of New Jersey. This new development would help me to gain a whole new perspective and that should help my writing and my blog here. For the next few months, expect posts with an American-Indian viewpoint (and the new category: America). It should be interesting. 

But where does Bon Jovi fit in all this? Well, Wikipedia [tells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayreville,_New_Jersey) me that the rocker spent his boyhood here, where I am now, in Sayreville. Well, who knows, maybe he penned down &#8220;I&#8217;ll Be There for You&#8221; on these streets.
