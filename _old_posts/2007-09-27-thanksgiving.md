Shoaib Malik&#8217;s comments, first words to the media in fact, after Pakistan lost to India in the T20 final, were on the lines of Islam. He said he wanted to thank the Muslims all over the world. Not everyone was amused. It could mean one of the following things:  
  
1. He wanted to prove that he is as much a Muslim, than his colleagues in the team who have joined the Tableeghi Jamaat.  
  
2. He indeed is on path treaded by the likes of Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-haq and Shahid Afridi.  
  
I do realize that Shoaib Malik does not have an enviable fluency of the English language (Apparently, the English tuitions that he had been taking, seems to be a failed attempt now. See [here](http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/302094.html), under the heading &#8220;The language barrier. No more&#8221;). I wonder if fluency in the language would have helped matters though. I think he said what he wanted to say. Maybe he meant to thank all the Muslims in the world who wanted Pakistan to win. It was a bad attempt to do so. Like many in blogosphere and elsewhere, I too think that Pakistani Christians and Hindus are perfectly justified to feel offended. I feel for their coach who is an Australian and perhaps more importantly in the context of the discussion, not a Muslim. I even feel for the guy in their support staff who was praying with folded hands while Misbah was fighting it out in the middle, only a few yards away.  
  
And if Shoaib indeed meant to thank _All_ the Muslims in the world, he certainly got it all wrong. Why would, for example, the second and third generation Pakistani Muslims, who are slowly making their way to English county cricket and dream of playing for the England team, want Pakistan to win? Why would Indian Muslims, a population that clearly outnumbers their counterpart citizens in Pakistan, be assumed to be Pakistani supporters?  
  
In more ways than one, this immature and irresponsible statement from the Pakistani skipper speaks volumes of the mentality that the Pakistan dressing room, if not Pakistan Cricket, must be soaked in.
