As I gasp for air, the words of Pink Floyd come to my ears.  
  
&#8220;There&#8217;s a silence surrounding me, I can&#8217;t seem to think straight&#8221;  
  
What precise timing. And there I was lying on the floor with my fists clutching the corners of the blanket. Sunlight washed the interiors of the room but I lay in darkness. My mind going blank, bleak with every passing moment. The only allowance, the music that overwhelmed the room.  
  
&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit in the corner, No one can bother me&#8221;  
  
The crushed bed sheet beneath me probably gave a hint of my restlessness. My feet numb and this state of inactiveness moving up, taking over my body, rendering it frozen, at it&#8217;s own pace.  
  
&#8220;My words won&#8217;t come out right, I feel like I&#8217;m drowning&#8221;  
  
In this state of momentary lapse of consciousness, sources of inspiration are extinct. Hope is not a bad thing to have, if you can find any that is.  
  
&#8220;Why won&#8217;t you talk to me. You never talk to me &#8221;  
  
That time and that sudden silence. I remember, first I was taken aback and then sank in it, like a burnt out Torpedo shell in the deep sea.  
  
&#8221; I sometimes wonder, Where do we go from here &#8221;  
  
Where could have we gone from there?  
  
If not here, then where?
