The magazine of todays Sunday Times of India carries an advertisement claiming Kerala to be a monsoon, honeymoon destination. It shows a young couple, in each others arms, under a tree, by a river as the rain is pouring in.  
  
On the left side of the advertisement, a line says &#8220;Showers of passion&#8221;.  
  
Now, I am nowhere near being in such a position, but I wonder if it were the case and if, impressed by this advertisement, I decide to goto Kerala, would they _allow_ me to do that? Won&#8217;t the police come and hit me? Won&#8217;t the moral police condemn it? Hell, I could even be on National television. Afterall, in India, [its almost criminal for a couple to even hold hands in public.](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1051202/asp/frontpage/story_5549864.asp) So what if they are married.
