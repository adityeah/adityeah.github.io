_This post, written on the 6th of June, posted tonight._

Now, to talk about Delhi.  
  
First of all, I think a lot of people don&#8217;t know that I _am_ from this city :P Though I have not stayed here much, I have done a substantial part of my schooling from Delhi (5 years) and have visited this city every year for the last 24 years. (Apart from a period while I lived here for 6 years, that is). So I, kind of, _know_ this place.  
  
I have seldom mentioned about my Delhi connections on my website.  
  
I went &#8216;exploring&#8217; the city today, all by myself. I went to Connaught Circus/Place and I must mention, that it is the _only_ other place in India that reminds me so much of the fountain area in Bombay. The pavement book-sellers, the cloth merchants, the water-vendors, the snack-sellers, the list does not seem to end. Of course, this time around, there were a few surprises. In my 30 minutes walk around the place, I came across two McDonalds restaurants (or were they three?) and one KFC. Three American junk-food restaurants, packed to the maximum, within a radius of one kilometer. See, this is the kind of foreign invasion we are dealing with here. That is, of course, if you think of it as a foreign invasion.  
  
New Delhi has changed. More for the better than for the worse. The better: The roads are wider, the city is flaunting its gleaming new metro rail, the new fly-overs keep welcoming the traffic. The worse: Delhi has less power, lesser water, as always. And yes, the people are ruder. Sorry guys, I think you really need a crash course in politeness.

Now that I have mentioned the &#8216;gleaming&#8217; new Metro rail, more on it has to be impending. The Metro, I feel, could be termed as the capital&#8217;s pride. I liked the fact that its _actually_ not running empty. It was full capacity during my short afternoon journey from &#8220;Rajiv Chowk&#8221; to &#8220;Chandni Chowk&#8221;. More than the fact that it is a top quality product, I think to complete the work schedule on time, cutting the red-tapism is in itself, is a bigger, better achievement. This is how plans should work. If you think about it, its a simple thing. It is nothing but a plan that has worked right on schedule. If this is what it can do for one city, the possibilities could be endless.

Evening, I watched &#8220;Da Vinci Code&#8221; at PVR Rivoli. Every old cinema hall nowadays has a &#8220;PVR&#8221; prefixed to its name. Put in good interiors, add a little polish, a little &#8216;garnish&#8217; and sell the tickets for Rs.200. Coming back to the movie, what a waste. No, not just the money. I am talking about Tom Hanks. You don&#8217;t need Hanks to play the role of Langdon. How to play Robert Langdon? Just keep popping your eyes in curiosity, appear to think all the time, keep mumbling to yourself, say &#8220;code&#8221; most of the time and keep listening to Sophie. Heck, even Tom Cruise could do it!
