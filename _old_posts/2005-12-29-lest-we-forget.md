Last Sunday, on Christmas, for [NDTV](http://www.ndtv.com) to come up with a story on the first anniversary of Tsunami was very thoughtful, probably, one of the few examples of responsible journalism. While most of the world looks ahead to the celebrations and joy the new year has in store, it is also required that we look back. Because if we don&#8217;t look back, we don&#8217;t learn. We need to look back, lest we forget.



I had been searching, without success, at NDTV.com archives for a link to that story, to share it here, with you. [Alaphia](http://alaphia.blogspot.com), a fellow blogger and one of the journalists who covered the report on Tsunami, has shared the very same script that she had narrated on the NDTV story. Thank you so much, Alaphia.

And yes, this is [remembrance week](http://worldwidehelp.blogspot.com/2005/12/remembrance-week-26th-december-2005.html). 



Lest we forget.
