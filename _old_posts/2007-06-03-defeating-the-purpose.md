I am yet to come across a single telephony/broadband internet company in India which does the basics right. For example, here is something that should not have taken more than 12 hours, but the problem is already 4 days old. Reason being, wrong information provided &#8212; repeatedly. My letter to the customer care department of the biggest GSM player in India, open for all.

Dear Telephone company,

When I first emailed you for the change of billing plan from my gmail address 3 days ago, I was asked to do so from my email address registered with you. When I emailed you from the email address that is registered with you (this yahoo.co.in email address), you have sent me another email, asking me to email you from my official email address. 

I am surprised how long, lengthy and irritating the whole process is turning out to be &#8212; especially since I have repeatedly mentioned that I want to go for this with &#8220;immediate effect&#8221;. It is obvious to me how much seriously you have taken my request for urgency in this regard.

You could have told me to send the email from my official address the first time itself. It has already been 3 days I have been requesting for the change of plan and all you are telling me since then is to email from one account to another. I am frustrated because you have told me to send the email from my official address NOW &#8212; on a Saturday evening, a weekend, when I can&#8217;t access my official email account until the next working day, that is Monday.

Its a pity that something that should have been sorted out by a single email has taken such a long time and still going on. Yours is an example of how the purpose of the email of being quick and fast to accomplish tasks, is totally defeated and lost. Its sad, frustrating and I will make sure that this case is heard by the masses &#8212; the people.

Thank you and you will have your email from my official email account on Monday. However, this email will go public today itself.

Aditya Kumar
