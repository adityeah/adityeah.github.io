Now, I don&#8217;t normally do this but sometimes we all do some things without any reason. 

Some songs have it in them to take you to another era, some other time of your life. Apparently, the song I am talking about also happens to be the only song that I have ever volunteered to dance on.

This song is originally by Ryan Adams, performed by The Corrs and Bono- the result is the best duet I have ever experienced. So allow me to present some words from this beautiful song.

<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8221; Dancin&#8217; where the stars go blue<br /> Dancin&#8217; where the evening fell<br /> Dancin&#8217; in your wooden shoes<br /> In a wedding gown
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Dancin&#8217; out on 7th street<br /> Dancin&#8217; through the underground<br /> Dancin&#8217; little marionette<br /> Are you happy now?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Where do you go when you&#8217;re lonely<br /> Where do you go when you&#8217;re blue<br /> Where do you go when you&#8217;re lonely<br /> I&#8217;ll follow you<br /> When the stars go blue, blue<br /> When the stars go blue, blue &#8220;
    </p>
