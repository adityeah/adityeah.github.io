Many people ask me, how do I find so much time to travel. Finding time is not difficult, if you want to. Okay thats not a practical answer. I have a few of rules I follow. **First, Jump at every and any opportunity to travel that comes your way.** **Second, Take at least one long vacation in the year**. Long vacation means far away. Say, from Bangalore to Kasauli; or to Kohima (that trip got cancelled, last year, thanks to whats been happening in Assam). **Third, never be afraid to travel alone**. I realise not everyone can do that, but I do it. **Fourth, feel it big.** How many times have you travelled, usually a short 2 day trip, and not _really_ felt it? Short trips appear trivial. But if you observe, look closely, look at the people, the land that lays ahead of you, you will experience a thousand different stories. Be open to it all. And then you learn.  
  
You feel your feet are happy when you travel, longing for more.  
  
About my last month&#8217;s trip to Goa. The good thing about going to Goa, my &#8216;home&#8217;, with a bunch of friends, is that I have to show them around. I become almost like a tourist guide. Normally, I won&#8217;t go and visit any tourist place, say, a cathedral or so-and-so beach. I mean, going to home for 3-4 days &#8212; I&#8217;d rather spend time at home with family than look around. But guests change that. I go to places I have gone only with guests. It&#8217;s like my own, exclusive, pre-decided &#8216;package-tour&#8217;. So last month when I travelled to Goa with my friends, I ended up taking long walks alone on the sea shore, clicking pictures while the gang played ball in the waves. Lots of quality time spent in solitude and the result? &#8212; Some of the best pictures I have ever clicked. I think so, neverthless.
