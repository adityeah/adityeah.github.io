I am happy that my all-time favorite U2 song is getting accolades even now, a good 15-or-so years after its release.  
  
In fact, &#8220;One&#8221; is the best song, I have ever listened to.  
  
Now, &#8220;One&#8221; has been re-released. The song, originally from the album Achtung Baby, has had it&#8217;s major re-release in the form of a collaboration between U2 and [Mary J Blige](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J_Blige). Bono starts the song with his voice and after a few lines lets Mary take over.  
  
Now, let me say, this new version is nothing exceptional and this is not the &#8216;accolade&#8217; I talked about. It&#8217;s this: From the song, this line &#8212; &#8220;One life, with each other, sisters, brothers&#8221;, has been reported Britain&#8217;s most adored lyric. The poll was conducted by the music channel, VH1.  
  
Other artists/songs in the top-10 include Nirvana&#8217;s Smells Like Teen Spirit, Coldplay&#8217;s Yellow (I love that song), Robbie William&#8217;s Angels and Eminem&#8217;s Loose Yourself.  
  
You know who I am missing here? [Oasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_%28band%29).
