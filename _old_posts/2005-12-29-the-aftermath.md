Last night, in Bangalore, a [suspected terrorist attack](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/28bang.htm), and the government has stepped into action now. But why were the [security arrangements &#8220;light&#8221;](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/29bang.htm), when New Delhi Police had already [warned the State Government](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/28bang1.htm), of something like this happening, beforehand? Why is the security situation being [reviewed by the state now](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/29bang1.htm), after the attack has happened? Why was this not done when the warning was issued? Why do incidents like these have to happen for the Government to wake up and take &#8220;precautionary&#8221; measures?
