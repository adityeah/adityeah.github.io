Alright, for the few who have been following up with this blog, perhaps you did notice a little change, eh? Well, nothing much has changed. The [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) version is now updated to 2.3. My loyalty to &#8220;[The Journalist](http://lucianmarin.com/journalist/)&#8221; WordPress Theme remains and I shall be ever thankful to [Lucian Marin](http://lucianmarin.com/) for creating it. The change in look, however, is a result of &#8220;upgrading&#8221; the theme to its latest version. It still remains true to its simplicity, I must say.  
  
More later.
