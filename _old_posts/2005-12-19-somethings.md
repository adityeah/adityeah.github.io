The [&#8220;30 Years Anniversary&#8221; Issue](http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20051226/index.shtml) from India Today. The big fat issue with the best of India-Today is a collector&#8217;s dream. And to say that at Rs 20 it&#8217;s a steal, would be an understatement.  
  
  
And [here](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2005/12/fine-year-for-books.html) is Uma&#8217;s excellent round up on the literature published this year.  
  
  
Also, don&#8217;t miss R.K.Laxman&#8217;s interview by Sonia Faleiro [here](http://soniafaleiro.blogspot.com/2005/12/yes-what-do-you-want.html).
