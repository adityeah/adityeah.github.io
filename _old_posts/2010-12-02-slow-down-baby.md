I, and with me this blog, have been experiencing a blogging slowdown of sorts. Lots of things going on, so many things to write about (including justified anger directed to my employer and an impending Java exam) but all that will have to wait because I have been invariably spending a good part of the day in BMTC volvos coming and going to office. 

You should read [this](http://www.tehelka.com/story_main48.asp?filename=Ne041210CoverstoryIII.asp) piece at tehelka, a perspective on the now infamous Nira Radia tapes. Another article on the same website, some comprehensive research and we have the life and times of Nira Radia, the lady herself, [here](http://tehelka.com/story_main48.asp?filename=Ne041210Coverstory.asp). I doubt if I have ever heard of any other woman who has (had?) &#8220;so much fire in her belly&#8221;, as the author put it. If I had known the lady, I would have given her only one advice &#8212; slow down, baby. 

Oh well, I am experiencing that first hand right now.

Enough stuff to ponder upon, so read up those links and you would be left thinking, just like me.
