This, from [here](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/bones/WhyIHateWebLogs.html), language cleaned up by [Dilip](http://dcubed.blogspot.com) and posted on his blog [here](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/2006/07/statement-of-audience.html). Just like Dilip, I agree with this too. That is why it makes it here.

> I realize that nothing I say matters to anyone else on the entire planet. My opinions are useless and unfocused. I am an expert in nothing. I know nothing. I am confused about almost everything. I cannot, as an individual, ever possibly know everything, or even enough to make editorial commentary on the vast vast majority of things that exist in my world. This is a stupid document; it is meaningless drivel that I do not expect any of the several billion people on my planet to actually read. People who do read my rambling, incoherent concertos are probably just as confused as I am, if not more so, as they are looking to me for an opinion when they should be outside playing Frisbee with their dog or serenading their life partner or getting a dog or getting a life partner. Anyone who actually takes the time to read my sonatas probably deserves to ingest my messed up and obviously mistaken opinions on whatever it is that I have written about.
