Uma&#8217;s [post](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2005/12/in-hospital-lift.html) has won the first prize for the the [&#8220;Can Conquer Cancer&#8221; Initiative](http://connexionsonline.biz/conxw/ican/). My [post](http://www.adityeah.com/2005/12/15/will-power/) and Dave&#8217;s writeup [here](http://www.preservationrecords.com/blog/entry.asp?ENTRY_ID=144), won the second prize (it was a tie :) The results can be seen [here](http://connexionsonline.biz/conxw/ican/index.php?cccid=results).  
  
I wish to thank the people involved in this initiative. It has been an effort, full of positivity. And, as I have said before, to conquer this disease, being positive is half the battle won.  
  
As you may have noticed, with the results announced, I am in such fine company. I am honored, and I don&#8217;t know what more to say. It was a surprise, my name there!  
  
Thank you, everyone.
