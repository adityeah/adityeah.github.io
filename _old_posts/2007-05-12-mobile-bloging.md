My internet service provider decided that enough was enough as it had been quite some time they had had an outage that lasted more than a day or two. So here i am, writing to you from my cell phone. Bono once said that cell phones are &#8216;dangerous little devices&#8217;. Yes. Anything that lets you blog from your bathroom is dangerous, i say. Anyway, this is turning out to be a long break now. And to some friends who have been left wondering where i have been all this while &#8211; i am very fine, all good! What more better evidence of my good spirits than the fact that i am doing this from my cell phone! Oh i just hope that this attempt is successful. Later!
