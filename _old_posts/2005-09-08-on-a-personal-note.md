On a personal note, I thought a post here should be a fitting tribute to my good old (heehee..\*\*devil grin\*\*..good, OLD) Blogger Friend, [EP](http://squashedbrain.rediffblogs.com). 

Happy Birthday EP. Keep sprinkling humor on your everyday experiences while you blog. 

EP once featured in Rediffblogs &#8220;Top Blogs&#8221; and thats how I came to know him. I dont know about others but I go through his archives and read stuff to lighten my mood many times. Here is [one](http://squashedbrain.rediffblogs.com/2004_25_07_squashedbrain_archive.html)&#8230;  
and this  [one](http://squashedbrain.rediffblogs.com/2004_01_08_squashedbrain_archive.html), which was when his blog made it to the Best of Rediffblogs.

Rock on, EP.
