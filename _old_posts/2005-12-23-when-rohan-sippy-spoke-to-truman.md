So when I asked him, the director of Bluffmaster, on the chat at rediff, exactly why did he work in a coffee shop in New York, I expected a better answer. Something like, maybe he wanted to see how it feels to work in a coffee shop in NY, to meet new people or to have a feel of the city probably because the city has inspired him all his life (Typical Bollywood).  
  
The answer was, well, he just wanted to earn some money. How boring.  
  
And before I could tell him that my friends did not like his movie, he was gone.  
  
But since I have not seen the movie as yet, I shall not (try to) be prejudiced. I am optimistic about the movie for many reasons, one of them is [this](http://grangergab.blogspot.com/2005/12/can-you-call-my-bluff.html).  
  
Mine is the second last question, [here](http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/dec/22rohan.htm).
