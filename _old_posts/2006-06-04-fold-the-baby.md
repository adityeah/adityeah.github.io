The sign, in Hindi, in front of my seat in the airplane says, &#8220;_mausam kharab ho toh kripya shishu ko fold karke rakhen_&#8220;. Meaning, if the weather is bad, please fold, right, fold, the baby. Yes, the baby.  
  
The same sign below, in English, says, if the weather is bad, please keep the baby wrapped in blankets.  
  
This, my dear readers, denotes the state of our own language, in our own land.
