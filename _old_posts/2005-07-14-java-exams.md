For the past month and a half (almost) I had been preparing for the SCJA (Sun Certified Java Associate) exam. This is a free BETA exam which Sun probably intends to make a standard in the distant future for entry level Java Programmers. 

Such overwhelming was the response to the free Certification exam that many &#8216;last-day&#8217; registeration requests were cancelled. And mine was one of them. So a couple of days before my exam I have just come to know that the exam for which I had been studying for the past 40 days is not going to happen. Now, however, since the much needed momentum has been gained, I intend to do the SCJP (Sun Certified Java Programmer) which, by all technical standards, is not only better than SCJA but also costs a cool Rs 7000. 

Meanwhile, I intend to post some of my Java Notes that I have scribbled during the course of my preparation, here on my site on a different page. Now that I will be appearing for the SCJP, the date of which has not been decided yet, I have some more time and I ought to be better prepared.
