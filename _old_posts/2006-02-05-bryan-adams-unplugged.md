In my graduation days, I listened to the audio tape of &#8220;Mtv Unplugged: Bryan Adams&#8221; so much that it finally broke down and I had to buy a new one.  
  
I also once owned the URL www.summerof69.net. I spent a lot of time and efforts to make a website dedicated to the singer :)  
  
So, when I was told that the Canadian was touring India, and Bangalore to be specific, I thought, wow.  
  
Oh, the pleasures of living in this city. Last year, Sting and now Bryan Adams.  
  
I am going for the concert in the evening :)  
  
This, below, in 2001, one of my dedications to the rock star. 0.5mm 2B on Plain Paper :)
