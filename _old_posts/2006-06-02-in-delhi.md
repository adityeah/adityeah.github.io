I will be in New Delhi for a week, starting tomorrow. Unlike my other trips, I can&#8217;t say that I am &#8216;travelling&#8217; since this is not the usual &#8216;Adventure\_&\_Explore&#8217; trip. Also, no train travel this time around.  
  
[Air Deccan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Deccan), this time, is my carrier of choice. I hope I get the [ATR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR) to fly in, since all the times I have travelled in [Indian Airlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Airlines), I have only got to see the [A-320s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A320). (Thats more-or-less all that Indian Airlines has, right?).  
  
Next post, from New Delhi.
