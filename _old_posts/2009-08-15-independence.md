A few hours before Independence day, watching Attenborough&#8217;s Gandhi, I am left with a few more observations and questions.

Gandhi united our country, north to south, east to west. He walked, people followed. Today, 62 years after Gandhi, we are falling apart. We have long forgotten that we are Indians first. We have made it very convenient to forget that. We believe it is all okay. We have let _chalta hai_ rule us.

Before 15th August 1947 we were fighting against the British Empire. Today we have to fight not only religionism but regionism as well. The worst part is, most people do not even realise it. Do a check and you will find that somewehere in it all, we have to fight ourselves. 

The leaders that we elect are not leaders, they are politicians. It is an irony that India&#8217;s last known leader never held an office.

I do not think that Gandhi was the only reason we got our independence. There were other factors too. But I admire Gandhi most because he stood up and unified the nation. Because he sparked a nation&#8217;s imagination. Because he believed that Gita or Quran, it is all okay as long as the path leads to God.

Believe it or not, The Mahatama was our last hero, our last leader.

My dream is this. I want to live in an India where her citizens think of themselves as Indians first. Where politicians are held accountable for the offices they hold. Where justice is not looked down upon. Where people are not scared to approach the court of law. Where _chalta hai_ doesn&#8217;t work anymore.

I wonder what happened to that dream Nehru had, the one he proclaimed to the world exactly 62 years ago as the clock approached midnight, just as it is now, as I write this. The same dream in which he mentioned India&#8217;s tryst with destiny. Don&#8217;t you think we have all lost our ways?

May there be Glory for India and her citizens.

Happy Independence Day.
