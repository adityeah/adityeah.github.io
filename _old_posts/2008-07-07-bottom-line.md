Copyright Declaration line written on the bottom of the cover of a DVD movie:

> We, (company name) have made this video film and are owner of the copyright in such work for the territory of all India including Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim.

Is it only me who finds this (line) strange or is there, indeed, something strange about it?

Comments and thoughts welcome. In fact, required.
