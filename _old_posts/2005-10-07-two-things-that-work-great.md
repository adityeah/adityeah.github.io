First is the [FooBar2000 Audio player](http://www.foobar2000.org/). foo and bar, as my friends from the computer science field will recognise, are two [variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) that are used extensively in syntax examples of the subject. But this is an Mp3 playing software that does its job nicely. It has no &#8220;jazz&#8221;, no skins, no &#8220;feel-good&#8221; look but it is probably the best Mp3 player that I have come across in terms of performance, memory usage (All it takes is a little more than 2MB of [RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access_memory)&#8211; Compare that to 12 MB taken by Winamp and almost 30 MB consumed by iTunes!). It is highly configurable, and very flexible. You can download it [here](http://www.foobar2000.org/download.html). And yes, highly recommended for techies. We all _realise_ how much precious RAM is!  
  
It will take time to get used to it but this is something that seems so simple yet packs quite a punch.  
  
Second thing that has worked great for me is [Coldplay&#8217;s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay) X&Y album. Good music to the core. [Chris Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin) and the gang has come of age! With the burden of expectations on Coldplay, X&Y is genius work.  
  
If you are into music of the U2, REM, Oasis kinds, I suggest you listen to this.  
  
This album grows on you. It will take time to get used to it but this is something that seems so simple yet packs quite a punch.
