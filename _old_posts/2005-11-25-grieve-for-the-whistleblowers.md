In the middle of the Bihar election results, one news initially went without notice.



Manjunath, a manager with the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), had ordered the closure of a petrol pump in Lakhimpur Kheri (State of Uttar Pradesh) sometime back. He was murdered.



The petrol dealers in the area never followed the norms. They sold adulterated fuel. Manjunath had the authority for closing these pumps down. Eventually he ordered the closure of three petrol pumps in the area. 



Manjunath had informed his father about the area he was posted in. It was unsafe, full of gangs and a mafia order was in place. He told that he did not get &#8220;proper official support&#8221;. His father asked him to let some things &#8220;go by&#8221;. Manjunath resisted, insisting that he wanted to change things, this was his challenge. 

As a student, Manju financed his own education. Perhaps, that goes on to say the kind of person he was.



As a graduage of IIML (Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow), Manjunath had the choice of leaving the job and getting himself something else, much safer and more attractive. It is the drive that fuels the majority of young professionals. But he chose not to. He wanted to change the system, giving all he can to his first job. 



And this is what the system gave him.



[Satyendra Dubey](http://skdubeyfoundation.org/index.php) and now Manjunath. Anyone who knows our system would agree that what Manjunath and Dubey found out, was just the tip of the iceberg.



Is this what our political and administrative system gives to whistleblowers? Can the Government offer anything more than the condolences?
