I know, I know, I have been away for this little while and have not posted anything of substance for this one month now. Heck, my posting frequency has hit an all time low. But there are reasons. Till last week, I was in the middle of jobs. Now, I have a new job and that means I cannot (yet) blog at work(!). Well, I admit, I did blog at work, wrote rough drafts if I had free time but right now I am not able to do that. Then I had also gone traveling for a week. 

Please bear with me while I try my best to balance things out and write something soon. Ciaos.
