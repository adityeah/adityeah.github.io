The kind of an evening when a car hits your car and runs away and you can&#8217;t do a thing.

So we were at HSR Layout. At Parangipalaya to be precise. There, the road goes thin. It is a single lane, if you can call it that, with lots of pedestrians and a hawker market on both sides. There are a couple of temples at one end of the road. Mostly, there is chaos there. OK, a different kind of chaos. Parangipalya is an area with mostly a high density of everything &#8211; people, traffic and everything else.

I don&#8217;t really know why I chose to take that road. I think it had something to do with where I was headed to. I was headed towards a neighbourhood which has an approach road similar to Parangipalya&#8217;s. I think that was what I thought &#8211; you avoid one, you hit another one of those anyway. And who&#8217;s to say that the main road had less traffic? All in all it did not demand that much thinking &#8212; to put things in perspective, this was merely 500 metre in length.

So anyway &#8211; as we were in the middle of this road, a black Ford Ikon came to my right, from behind. The man behind the wheel was fast, I barely saw him in the rear view mirror. He zipped by my A-Star (which was not more than 20-25 Kmph), and then as he overtook my car, from the wrong lane, he perhaps saw the traffic coming from the other side. In a hurry to come back to the right lane (in order to avoid a front-on collision) his car&#8217;s behind hit my car&#8217;s right edge of the front bumper and the body. Our car shook. The whole thing lasted less than 10 seconds.

The next moment I saw this car slowing down and moving towards the left side. My first thought was that he seemed to be slowing down. I then realized that it took a little time for him to register that he had hit a car (from the behind) and then I saw him speeding up. I went on a chase, trying to confront him. Meanwhile, my wife was pleading me to stop and trying to talk some sense. I sped up, drove rash and I could later hear my wife screaming and the baby panicky. I went on a chase, for the next 5 minutes or so, with this car in front of me all the while. I realized we were going around the same roads. Finally, sanity prevailed and I stopped my car on the side. I examined the damage done and eventually drove towards our planned destination.

In hindsight, it was a stupid thing to do from my part, I completely get that. I have never really been in a similar situation before and I did not know how to react. I snapped. But the fact that I drove rash, putting all our lives, those of my family and those outside, in danger (small or big risk &#8211; I do not know, it does not matter) was inexplicable. 

I thought about it a lot and the thing that I am still wondering is this: What would I have done, had I finally nabbed this guy? I certainly did not want any money. I think what angered me more than the fact that he hit my car was that he ran away after hitting us. Maybe all I wanted was for him to accept that he was wrong and say sorry and move on. 

But seeking that, I went to another extreme, which, without a doubt, was not justified at all.

ps: I am trying to come back to blogging so if you&#8217;re reading this, drop in a comment. I&#8217;d love to know if people still read blogs!
