A few days after I told my house owner that I would like to vacate the house I am in now, word seems to have spread fast across the estate brokers of my colony. So much that after a few days of it, I notice that my house has a &#8220;TOLET&#8221; board on. How it came there and since when it has been there, I have no idea. 

On the electrical pole, across my house, another &#8220;TOLET&#8221; message. It says, &#8220;Indievisual houses for rent &#8211; 1,2,3 BHK&#8221; and then on another line, &#8220;4,5,6 BHK&#8221;. Oh yeah, I want one too, an &#8220;Indievisual House&#8221;. Oh no wait, what if I want a &#8220;7,8,9 BHK&#8221;? Where&#8217;s that pattern gone, now?

Can&#8217;t help but notice a similar lack of patterns at my office cafe. On the price list: 

&#8220;gravy with 3 roti &#8211; Rs.30  
gravy with 4 roti &#8211; Rs 40  
gravy with 5 roti &#8211; Rs 50&#8221;

People don&#8217;t eat gravy with 6 roti, oh no.
