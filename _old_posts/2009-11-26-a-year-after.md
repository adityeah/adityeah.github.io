One year since the November 26 2008 carnage that happened in Mumbai and we have already found more important things to talk about.

We have, for example, witnessed a &#8220;furore in the House&#8221; (as promised) when one MLA chose to take his oath in another language but Marathi. We witnessed how a few elected to the office by the people can transform into goondas as and when convenient.

If only all the promises were kept and taken in the same vain by them who were making them, our country would have been a much better place to live in.

We have also witnessed a national hero proclaiming that He is proud to be a Maharashtrian but reinstated that Mumbai is of whole India. As always, he got his priorities right but then we also witnessed the grand old man, the self-proclaimed big daddy of the Marathi Manoos, telling the former that his comments had hurt, no prizes for guessing who, the Marathi Manoos. 

Never has the &#8220;Proud to be an Indian&#8221; comment raised so much controversy.

Then, of course, we also know that calling the city &#8220;Bombay&#8221; (and not &#8220;Mumbai&#8221;) can get you thrown out of the city limits.

This is November 26, a year after. Of prime importance, these things.

**Postscript**: Coming in just now, the political party that owns the goondas who fulfilled the promise mentioned above has put up a hoarding in Mahim paying homage to the martyrs of 26/11. But only the Marathi Manoos among those heroes find a space there. Bangalore&#8217;s Major Unnikrishnan and Dehra Dun&#8217;s Hawaldar Bisht have been conveniently forgotten &#8212; their sins being that they were not the Marathi Manoos. Look at the picture [here](http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/nov/26/anniversary-26-11-mns-hoarding-forgets-non-marathi-heroes.htm) and you will notice, the political heroes who have put this hoarding up have their own faces enlarged on the poster &#8212; larger than the faces of the people they are supposedly paying homage to.
