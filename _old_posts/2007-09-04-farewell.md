The last time I met Mr.J.B. D&#8217;Souza, in fact the only time I met him, he told me that he was a World war II veteran. And then we talked about books. And Maharashtra politics. 

He was one of those with whom a man like me can talk, for hours, without knowing a thing. I admit I didn&#8217;t know him that well but of whatever I knew of him, it warrants me to write this.

So Dear Sir, you will be missed. My thoughts and prayers are with Dilip and his family. May God give you the strength to walk on.
