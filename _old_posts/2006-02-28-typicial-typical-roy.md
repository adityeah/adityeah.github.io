On a comeback trail from what seems to be my longest break from Blogosphere in the last 3 years, I present you [Arundhati Roy&#8217;s Article in today&#8217;s Hindu.](http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/28/stories/2006022804301100.htm)  
  
I can&#8217;t help but say, this is typical Arundhati. Overly aggressive but yes, making a point.
