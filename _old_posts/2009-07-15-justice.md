Three years ago, a professor in Ujjain, was beaten in front of the cameras. He died on the way to the hospital, succumbing to a cardiac arrest. Later that evening, the clips were shown on television. 

Day before yesterday, all six accused [walked free](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_all-six-accused-in-prof-sabharwal-murder-case-acquitted_1273635). Reason? Lack of evidence.

This, after the crime was committed and caught on camera.
