My New Year was no celebration at all, I was browsing the internet on my computer at home. But yes, music is an important aspect of anything that I do on days like these, so I played U2&#8217;s &#8220;The Unforgettable Fire&#8221; and &#8220;New Year&#8217;s Day&#8221;. I needed Bono&#8217;s reassuring, full-of-hope voice.  
  
Bono&#8217;s like an old friend to me now. So even if he sings a sad song, I manage to pull out some hope everytime I hear him.  
  
We all have our problems, small and big. It has been a tough year for the World as well. The Tsunami aftereffects, The London bombings, the Delhi bombings, the Kashmir Earthquake, to name a few. People have lost, people have grieved. For me, there has been a personal loss as well.  
  
**The New Year _is_ hope for all of us.** It&#8217;s that time when we have the opportunity to start over, to wipe the slate clean and to give everything a fresh start. I hope that it turns out to be a year that is good and full of hope for all of you, the readers of this blog whom I know, and those who choose not to comment and decide against letting their presence felt.  
  
It would be naive to believe that problems shall go away. They will persist, like always. Here, I wish that the &#8220;fine balance&#8221; is achieved. Its something that is explained below in the post, so please continue reading.

Meanwhile, A Very Happy New Year.  
  
On a lighter note, the Truman Specials for this year. In no particular order.  
  
1. **The Best Album Truman listened to**  
  
Without doubt, U2&#8217;s &#8220;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&#8221;. It grows on you, and finally gets you! What an album this!  
  
2. **Errr.. The Best (Non-U2) Artist/Album Truman listened to**  
  
I feel it has to be Coldplay&#8217;s X&Y. Oasis comes a close second with &#8220;Standing on the shoulder of Giants&#8221;. Figures say a little different story though. In the second half of the year, I listened to 285 songs of Oasis and 197 songs of Coldplay. (U2&#8217;s count for the second half of the year? 694 songs)  
  
3. **Best Hindi movie Truman watched full screen**  
  
Iqbal. But do I have a choice? Hardly good movies released this year! (I liked &#8220;Sehar&#8221; too)  
  
4. **Best Hollywood movie Truman watched full screen**  
  
Cinderella Man. No doubt. But Harry Potter comes a close second. &#8220;Finding Neverland&#8221; comes third.  
  
5. **&#8220;If-only-I-could-see&#8221; movie for this year**  
  
[Anniyan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniyan). I wish to see this movie. But I can&#8217;t understand Tamil. I wish I could!  
  
6. **Cricketing action of the year**  
  
The Ashes, what else? But then again, the England-Pakistan series was such a downer.  
  
7. **Arrogant Cricketer of the year**  
  
[Andre Nel](http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/46569.html) of South Africa. Click on the link to see his face and you shall know who we are dealing with.  
  
8. **Best place Truman visited this year**  
  
Home :)  
  
heh, actually, [Kasauli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasauli). And I intend to visit it again. A close second comes, [Karwar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karwar)  
  
9. **Last but not the least, The Best Indian Author book Truman read this year**  
  
Difficult. Very, very difficult. Hmmm.. I would say &#8220;[A fine balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fine_balance)&#8221; by [Rohinton Mistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohinton_Mistry).  


This is the &#8220;Fine Balance&#8221; line I was talking about, something that applies to all of us: &#8220;**You cannot draw lines and compartments, and refuse to budge beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stones to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair&#8230;In the end, it&#8217;s all a question of balance** _Pg 231, &#8216;A Fine Balance&#8217;_ &#8220;.  
  
[Dr. Amitav Ghosh&#8217;s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitav_Ghosh) &#8220;The Glass Palace&#8221; comes very close. These books are very moving, in their own ways. Essentials of Indian Literature, these.  
  
But the common factor in these books, is this feeling that overwhelms you, that is reflected in the words below:  


> &#8216;Holding this book in your hand, sinking back in your soft arm-chair, you will say to yourself: perhaps it will amuse me. And after you have read this story of the great misfortunes, you will no doubt dine well, blaming the author for your own insensitivity, accusing him of wild exaggeration and flights of fancy. But rest assured: this tragedy is not a fiction. All is true.&#8217;
> 
> &#8212; HonorÃ© de Balzac, _Le Pere Goriot_ 

**  
The best thing for me, at a personal level, has been the literature I have read. The treasure is endless and it is priceless. The year gone by, has been the year of the Indian Authors. And no, I am not just talking about the Authors who write books. Just as important, are the Writers who exist in Blogosphere. I want to thank you, to each one of them, for Writing. Writing for a cause, Writing when provoked, Writing to Inspire and more importantly, Writing with responsibility. They know who they are.**  
  
Thats it for now, signing off!
