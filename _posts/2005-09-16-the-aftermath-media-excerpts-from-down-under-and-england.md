As expected, the Australian Team is facing the heat down under. Opinion seems to be divided- on one hand we have greats like Dennis Lillee, Ian Chappell and Michael Slater asking for Buchanan&#8217;s removal and on the other hand we have former Captain, Mark Taylor, who [believes](http://foxsports.news.com.au/story/0,8659,16617054-23212,00.html) Ricky has &#8220;generally&#8221; done well with the captaincy. Meanwhile, Buchanan is busy finding silver lining(s) in the recent defeats [here](http://www20.sbs.com.au/theashes/index.php?pg=nw&id=429).  
  
Jason Gillespie intends to go back to the basics of bowling, train hard and come back fine, afterall, &#8220;it&#8217;s not rocket science&#8221;. More [here](http://www20.sbs.com.au/theashes/index.php?pg=nw&id=430). By the way, can he take Zaheer Khan and Agarkar with him, too?  
  
If the Australians were good, England were better. But here&#8217;s the fine print- the Australians were not good all the time. They did not play their usual brand of cricket and they know it. Slip-ups by the Australians have happened, there is no denying that fact. The nervousness is there to see.  
  
The English press is celebrating and how. The Telegraph is [offering](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/09/13/ucdvd13.xml&sSheet=/sport/2005/09/15/ixsport.html) a &#8220;Ashes Heroes&#8221; DVD for free to it&#8217;s readers. Now rare moments of Hoggard hitting a boundary and Ricky Ponting&#8217;s clueless face expressions at office will be revived on home television.

On a more serious note, Coach Fletcher warns the English team to not to let it go to their heads. Mirror reports [here](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/tm_objectid=16131556%26method=full%26siteid=94762%26headline=don%2dt%2dlet%2dit%2dgo%2dto%2dyour%2dheads%2d%2dlads-name_page.html).  
  
I guess the best way to look at the English celebrations is through pictures. [CricInfo](www.cricinfo.com) helps me out here.

I wish I could find a picture of Michael Atherton, the former English Captain, smiling at the presentation ceremony- I have never seen him smile so much!  
  
Signing off, for now.
