A month after the Mumbai attack, we limp on. We search for love and peace. One guy in Brigade road, Bangalore, [gives free hugs to strangers](http://bangalorebuzz.blogspot.com/2008/12/jaadu-ki-jhappi-on-brigade-rd.html). Some find peace in sending greeting cards.  
  
Pakistani terrorists attack India. India ups the rhetoric. Pakistan deploys most of its army on the India border. India still talks diplomacy. Pakistan continues the troop build-up and checks if its nuclear bombs are in place. India talks more, says no war. Pakistan says no war too, but the Army is still out there aiming at us. I am just wondering, who should be calling the shots here. And who is.  
  
Meanwhile the politicians hit back with two very disturbing comments. And probably the only thing more disturbing than the comments are the two people who these comments come from. [Here](http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/I-welcome-emergence-of-Hindu-terrorists-Thackeray/402024/) and [here](http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/dec/28we-owe-to-militants-pak-for-peaceful-voting-farooq.htm). Farooq&#8217;s comment is particularly disturbing because he is one man who never misses an opportunity to give some credit, to pat the back of the guys across the border. Playing both sides &#8212; an old habit of his.  
  
All these years I didn&#8217;t vote. Somewhere, somehow, I am partly responsible for all this. Now, I can&#8217;t wait.
