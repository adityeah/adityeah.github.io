While I have been away due to affairs related to matrimony (no, I am not married yet!) there have been things happening around.

One such thing that caught my notice today, in my inbox was a petition against the fair usage policy that has been set out as terms and conditions of broadband usage by at least two operators here in India &#8212; Airtel Broadband and Tata Indicom Broadband.

What they are doing is this &#8212; in case you have a monthly unlimited data usage broadband plan and if you end up using it beyond a certain &#8220;limit&#8221;, you will either be browsing at a &#8220;slower&#8221; speed thereafter (Airtel) or you would be asked to cut down on downloads, asked to upgrade your plan (so that you can download more until you reach a similar threshold) and eventually get your connection terminated because of this.

Airtel Broadband limits you to download 15 GB on a 256kbps connection. Tata Indicom has set itself to 45 GB on a 256 kbps connection.

This has come as a shocker to the subscribers of the unlimited data plans. I am unaware of any such limitations set by broadband service providers out there in the west and it defies logic. They should NOT be calling it an unlimited usage plan for starters.

In the long run, I would say this would turn out to be two-step backwards. A move like this would turn out to be ridiculous. As computer applications and their usage becomes more and more internet-centric, it is imperative that the user won&#8217;t be able to keep a tab on the usage and download of data from the internet. Enable Windows updates, check the automatic updates for the antivirus, browse youtube while having a laugh, check out some music at last.fm or the online indie radio station, talk to your friend in the US over skype and before you know, you have already downloaded close to 1 GB of data. Now, consciously, you have not downloaded anything. You don&#8217;t have any new data that you can use for yourself on your pc. 

This is an example of computer usage becoming more internet-centric and the fair usage policy they have come up with, goes very much against it.

There are restaurants where you can &#8220;eat-all-you-can&#8221; for a certain amount of money. If someone abuses it &#8212; pays the amount everyday and then guzzle up food that&#8217;d be sufficient for 10 guys, the management would find ways to discourage him from entering the restaurant. This is exactly what our broadband companies are treating this as. And this is exactly what they should not be doing. 

Meanwhile, if you are aware of any such thing happening in the USA, please tell!
