title:  "Things that are out of stock and The Asymptomatics"
---

**EVERYDAY**, we hear something that surprises us. 

Essentials running out of supply can be expected, and in some ways, anticipated.  But today a friend told me how things that'd never get off shelves are suddenly running out of stock. Here are a few examples:

 - Weights (Dumbbells) 
 - Nintendo Switch video game consoles.
 - Home office furniture
 - Desktop Monitors

Come to think of it, the reasons these things are out of stock are fairly obvious. 

Meanwhile, back in India, Google has restricted the maximum video resolution to 480p on mobiles. This is to save bandwidth.

Meanwhile, I'll try to keep a tab on the news reports I keep reading (and hearing). There's so much of information floating around, it is difficult to keep a track of it. Here goes.

 The asymptomatic angle of this disease continues to baffle. [Today's Coronacast podcast at ABC radio](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/under-the-radar-how-much-coronavirus-is-really-out-there/12112066) talks about how some people who displayed no symptoms but were positive with COVID-19. These people had no "obvious" links and had flu-like symptoms. Out of 130, 7 were positive - which is 5%. 

But it does not end there. South China Morning Post, in [an article published on March 22nd](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3076323/third-coronavirus-cases-may-be-silent-carriers-classified) talks about one-third of COVID-19 cases could be silent carriers, or, in other words, asymptomatic.

But it gets weirder. on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, out of 634 infected people, [about 50% of the cases were asymptomatic.](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180) 

Detecting asymptomatic carriers is only possible when one becomes "liberal" with testing and that hasn't been the case so far with most countries. But guess what is common between the few places ([this](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-31/how-south-korea-created-the-world-s-most-ambitious-coronavirus-testing-programme/), and [this](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-21/one-italian-town-is-bucking-the-countrys-coronavirus-curve/12075048)) that have successfully contained the virus so far?
