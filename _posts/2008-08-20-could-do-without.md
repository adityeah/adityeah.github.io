In the three weeks that saw this blog, the writer of this blog and the world&#8217;s largest democracy grow an year old there were a few things that we could have done without. To name a few:

1. The bombs in the city were too many and enough to spark a debate, yet again, on how safe we are. A few more days of debates and now we are going back to our comfort zones until the bombs show up again, which will bring us back to square one.

2. The internet doesn&#8217;t work at nights. Why? Well, after three successful attempts of stealing the local internet server and numerous unsuccessful ones, the local service engineer had had enough of the robbers. Refusing to take any more chances he decided to do what I thought was strange (if not absurd) but at least safe &#8212; he took the internet server offline and shifted it to a safe house every night. That I access internet at night doesn&#8217;t matter, of course.

3. My yahoo email spam has increased by more than 10 times. Right, that would be 1000%. I believe this was a &#8220;revenge&#8221; taken by a website. All I did was unsubscribed their newsletter earlier forced upon me. Now they have forced upon me 10 spam emails everyday. And these are those emails that bypass the spam filter and land in my inbox. Right from &#8220;Malasian Lottery&#8221; (Not _Malaysian_) to Microsoft announcing Cash rewards. Whatever it is, it surely exposes Yahoo&#8217;s Spamguard&#8217;s failure. Yahoo&#8217;s yet another failure while trying to get the spammer off its back. One failed attempt worth reading [here](http://www.0x000000.com/?i=502).

Some more things that I remember(ed) but fail to make the cut now. Too hectic at work these days. I should write more.
