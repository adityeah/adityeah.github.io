For the last 9 months or so, I had been working on a story involving background verification industry, résumé fraud in the Indian IT sector and the state of technical education in India. The story took a lot &#8212; it is the toughest writing that I have ever done, and so finally I am glad to be able to write this that it has been featured in the Reportage section of April&#8217;s issue of Caravan magazine. 

You can access it online [here](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/chequered-pasts).

I want to thank the editors at Caravan who I had the wonderful opportunity to work with in the last 9 months. It was one heck of a learning curve. I feel the magazine is filling an important void in Indian journalism and at the same time has a pivotal role to play in the years to come. It has been rightfully compared to the likes of The New Yorker. I am just a part time writer who is always on the lookout for a good story, so for them to give someone like me an opportunity (again) means a lot to me.

Thanks to the few people who have inspired me, who continue to inspire me with simple things like what they do in their everyday lives. To close friends who have reviewed countless times the drafts that eventually landed at the Editor&#8217;s desk. To friends who have genuinely felt for me &#8212; forever in my heart, come what may. They know who they are.

There were a lot of &#8220;takeaways&#8221; from this experience and I probably would write them down as a separate blog post but for now, let me just say that I would be happy to return to regular blogging.

More later!
