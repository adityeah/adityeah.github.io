    <p>
      <b>The Puppy Song</b> <i>by Harry Nelson</i><br /> <br /> Dreams are nothing more than wishes<br /> And a wish&#8217;s just a dream you wish to come true<br /> <br /> If only I could have a puppy<br /> I&#8217;d call myself so very lucky<br /> Just to have some company<br /> To share a cup of tea with me<br /> I&#8217;d take my puppy everywhere<br /> La la la la I wouldn&#8217;t care<br /> Then we&#8217;ll stay away from crowds<br /> With signs that say no dogs allowed<br /> Oh we&#8230; I know he&#8217;d never bite me<br /> We&#8230; I know he&#8217;d never bite me<br /> <br /> If only I could have a friend<br /> Who sticks with me until the end<br /> And walk along beside the sea<br /> To share a bit of moon with me<br /> I&#8217;d take my friend most everywhere<br /> La la la la I wouldn&#8217;t care<br /> And we&#8217;ll stay away from crowds<br /> With signs that say no friends allowed<br /> Oh we&#8230;we&#8217;d be so happy to be&#8230;<br /> We&#8230;we&#8217;d be so happy to be together<br /> <br /> But dreams are nothing more than wishes<br /> And a wish&#8217;s just a dream you wish to come true<br /> Dreams are nothing more than wishes<br /> And a wish&#8217;s just a dream<br /> You wish to come true<br />
