Most news channels yesterday night, beamed &#8220;Breaking News&#8221;. What could it be, I wondered? Another bomb blast? Some Natural calamity? Turned out, [Aishwarya Rai had agreed to marry Abhishek Bachchan](http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/14ash.htm). And what breaking news it turned out to be. Heartbreaking News rather, for all those Aish fans.  
  
My life has changed since then. It will never be the same again. Afterall, the giggle goddess has finally zeroed in on one man and it has turned out to be a matter of national importance. What a drastic turn of events. Aby&#8217;s baby has finally found _his_ baby. Oh, I am so sorry dear Salman and Vivek..oops, Viveik..err.. Viviek.

Live feed of the marriage could be hitting your TV screens soon. Tell you what, can&#8217;t wait for that one too.
