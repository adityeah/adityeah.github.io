Taking an (enforced) break from the world wide web and blogging (and email, youtube&#8230;). As the blogposts (to be read) pile up my inbox there was one email (blog posting alert that is) that caught my attention. Subject: Gas Consumption: California vs. China, India. This post from [Sepiamutiny.com](http://www.sepiamutiny,com) throws an interesting and probably alarming statistic &#8212; That California consumes more Gasoline per year than China or India.



> But, at least with transportation fuel, youâ€™d be wrong. California alone uses more gasoline than any country in the world (except the US as a whole, of course). **That means Californiaâ€™s 20 billion gallon gasoline and diesel habit is greater than Chinaâ€™s! (Or Russiaâ€™s. Or Indiaâ€™s. Or Brazilâ€™s. Or Germanyâ€™s.)** 

This excerpt is from another blog that the sepiamutiny post links to. Read the whole thing [here](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/005297.html).
