This is late, in fact I did not even know that today is the last day for blog-voting at [Indibloggies](http://www.indibloggies.org/). Awards for the best of Indian Blogs for the year that has just passed by. I have just voted :)  
  
And I shall be clear about whom I have voted for. Here are the categories, and my choice:  
  
The best Indiblog of 2005  
[Uma&#8217;s Indianwriting](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com) 

Select the Best Topical IndiBlog of 2005  
[Sonia Faleiro](http://soniafaleiro.blogspot.com)

Select the Best Group Blog of 2005  
[Desipundit](http://www.desipundit.com)

Select the Best IndiBlog directory/service/clique of 2005  
[Desipundit](http://www.desipundit.com)

I did not have to think twice while making these choices, the people associated with these blogs are wonderful people and write _inspiringly_ well. I know that.  
  
If you are a blogger as well, then please, please go and vote! Today is the last day!
