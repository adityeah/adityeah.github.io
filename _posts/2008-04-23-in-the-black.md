If you read this, whoever you are, leave a comment. I seem to have trouble figuring out how many people even read this weblog. Have I hit an all time low? Maybe. I feel a shadow of my former self. No, really.  


Now, as far as blogging is concerned, instinctive, &#8220;at-the-moment&#8221; writing is not my cup of tea but come to think of it, that made me a better blogger 4 years back. Maybe I have been taking it too seriously. But then again, talking about my favorite color on the blog is a waste. No one is bothered, no one should be bothered.  
  
I have decided that if writing in me has to stay alive, I will have to write more. They say, if you are uncomfortable doing something, you have to do it more to make things in order. So there. If I am to write more, I know I will end up writing irrelevant and then some &#8220;not-so-relevant&#8221; things. I think if there is a way ahead, this is it.  
  
As I mentioned, I would need you to comment. I know some people who (used to) read me here but never comment(ed). I know how it seems to be in the black &#8212; Can&#8217;t see or be seen or whatever. It&#8217;s not that good a thing, to be a silent spectator. Its unfair. So speak up, please.
