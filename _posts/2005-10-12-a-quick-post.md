Okay, a couple of things here.

For good writing lovers, check Outlook Magazine&#8217;s [10 years: anniversary special](http://outlookindia.com/archivecontents.asp?fnt=20051017).  
  
It has columns by [Pankaj Mishra](http://www.nybooks.com/authors/196), Tarun Tejpal (of [tehelka.com](http://tehelka.com/)), [Sagarika Ghose](http://www.sawnet.org/books/authors.php?Ghose+Sagarika) , [Pico iyer](http://www.rolfpotts.com/writers/iyer.html), [Sham Lal](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020303/spectrum/book1.htm), [Khushwant Singh](http://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/khushwantsingh.html) and [Gabriel Garcia Marquez](http://almaz.com/nobel/literature/1982a.html), to name a few.  
  
And trust me on this, at Rs 15, it&#8217;s a steal.

Secondly, for all those lucky souls who have not upgraded their &#8220;yahoo messenger&#8221; to the new, &#8220;yahoo messenger with voice&#8221;- please stay away from this new version. It has lots of bugs. To name a few:

1. Sign in, Sign off and then Sign in again- _and zap_, the application crashes. I have checked this on both WinXP and Windows 2000 machines. 

2. Late message delivery. The messages, for some strange reason, are not delivered on time. It takes a while for the message to appear on the other side. It is not because of any firewalls, routers etc because till last month when I was using the old messenger, anything like this never came up. 

Now, you might ask how do I know that the messages are sent late.

I talk with my colleagues on Instant messengers all the time, even though they are seated a couple of feet away from me.
