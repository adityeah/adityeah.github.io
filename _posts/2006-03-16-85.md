**Inspired**, yes, Inspired is the word that always comes in handy when people have to imitate something. The [idea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Home_Page) of the [Million Dollar Home page](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) has been &#8216;inspiring&#8217; and we now have a [Crorepatipage](http://crorepatipage.com/). Even the website design has been ripped off! Where has all the originality gone?
