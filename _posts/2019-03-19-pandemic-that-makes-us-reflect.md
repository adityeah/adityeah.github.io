# A Pandemic that'll make us reflect.

**IN** a way it's ironic - it took a pandemic to make me blog again.  
  
My intention is simply to record my thoughts, as we collectively go through this time - an event of such magnitude. Think about it - a microbe has brought the human civilisation to its knees.  
  
Last week we were told to be working from home for a couple of weeks (until the end of March 2020). Now, I am not the kind of person who wants to work from home until it is really required and I was looking forward to it. On a personal level, I never thought that'd ever happen.  
  
So here I am, revving up a journal blog with a title I had chosen off a Wallflower's song, back in 2011. Little did I know then that this name would one day somehow fit magically with the times and place we'll find ourselves in.  
  
More later.
