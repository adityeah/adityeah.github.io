The Bourne Ultimatum is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a long, long time. Tell you what, I hope it remains that way.  
  
The Bourne Trilogy has been one of the few critically acclaimed chain of movies. Apart from the fact that all the movies have been brilliantly directed, the stronghold that runs parallel to all these three movies is that they have a well-formed, captivating and ultimately a proven storyline.  
  
There is one more ingredient to the movie that is as important as everything. Matt Damon. I saw Matt Damon&#8217;s movie, The Rainmaker, back in 1997 when I was 16. It was special for various reasons. It was my first multiplex experience and it introduced me to an author, one John Grisham, whose books I would go on to read for the rest of my time until I read them all. Matt Damon, of course, impressed me then &#8212; of whatever I could judge him. Now I realize, 10 years later, and I am sure of it &#8212; This man was born to do it. Rather, Bourne to do it. This trilogy is what Matrix is to Keanu Reeves.  
  
Oh and by the way, the ending also features an exclusive remix of Moby&#8217;s Extreme Ways. This song, in one form or the other, has been used in all the Bourne movies to give the final kick to the ending. And some kick it does give.
