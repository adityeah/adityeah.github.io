title:  "About Tiny Bubbles and Masks"
---

**BEFORE** anything, I want to understand the meaning of an "airborne" disease: Any diseases that are caused via transmission through the air, with the pathogens (or less specifically, any disease causing agents), present in aerosols < 5 micrometre in diameter. That size matters because, I think any larger droplets would be driven to the ground because of gravity. 

Is COVID-19 airborne? The jury is still out on that. Here's [something](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00974-w) something to read on that. But most of whatever I read mentioned a specific study [specific study ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446v2) in The University of Nebraska where they found virus RNA scattered at hard to reach places of rooms that were treating COVID-19 patients. The RNA lingered in the air, six feet away from the patients, and even in the hallway.

Think of these aerosols as tiny soap bubbles suspended in the air, traveling around with random gushes of wind. So, now I am considering, even with no one in sight, am I doing the right thing by taking a walk around the apartment? What if someone with the disease had sneezed there an hour ago and I walk right into that viral cloud? 

The question invevitably comes about how much of this is too much? How many of these suspended particles do I need to run into to make myself infected? Here's a block of quote from an incredible [article just published from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/) :

>In February, scientists in Wuhan, China—where the coronavirus outbreak originated—sampled the air in various public areas, and showed that the virus was either undetectable or found in extremely low concentrations. The only exceptions were two crowded sites, one in front of a department store and another next to a hospital. Even then, each cubic meter of air contained fewer than a dozen virus particles. (No one knows the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2—that is, the number of particles needed to start an infection—but for the original SARS virus of 2003, one study estimated somewhere between 43 and 280.)

So, I guess, it is OK to take that walk. For now.

But what about masks?

Earlier we were told to only use them if we are infected and that advice still stands. I think the idea behind that was to limit the consumption of masks because there is a shortage and the medical workers need it most. But now the overall sentiment around it seems to be changing. Here's the [NPR podcast](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825277364/the-mask-debate-preventing-more-new-york-sized-clusters)  that talks about it. The Atlantic article quoted above also mentions an experiment that even using a tea towel or a t-shirt is better than using nothing at all. 

I think we are living in a world that does not have enough data and experiments done on its latest adversary yet, so I think, it is better to take the safe way out.
