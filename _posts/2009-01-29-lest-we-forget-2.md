While my Republic day was spent as I&#8217;d (once in a while) want it to &#8212; in a train on a cross-country ride that spanned numerous states and 2500 KM, The Hindustan Times Republic Day special, New Delhi late city edition, has something I&#8217;d want to be published a little more often. This newspaper, already 2 days old and living in a constant threat of being pushed in a pile of its older counterparts, has things I&#8217;d like to mention on my blog here. So before this forewarning becomes realistic any further, here I would like to take 9 names that spell Bravery, Heroism and much more. Most of these people mentioned below, have been awarded the country&#8217;s highest Gallantry Awards. In a country so short of heroes, here are a few. I am producing this as is, from the newspaper &#8212; Lest we forget.
