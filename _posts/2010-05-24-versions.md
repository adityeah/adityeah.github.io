At timesofindia.com, [a report](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Pak-troops-fire-at-Indian-positions-in-JK/articleshow/5964769.cms) that is carried by many other Indian news sources, about Pakistan troops opening fire in Pooch, a sector along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir &#8212; Violation of cease fire by firing mortar bombs and rockets. Also mentioned is a jawan on the Indian side who was critically injured. 

Dawn, Pakistan&#8217;s premier newspaper [reports](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/22-pakistan-soldier-killed-in-kashmir-border-firing-military-aj-03) a very similar story at its website dawn.com &#8212; There was fire yes, but &#8220;due to unprovoked firing by Indians&#8221;. In fact, a Pakistani soldier &#8220;embraced martyrdom&#8221; in all this. 

Both highly respected publications in their own part of the world, reporting the same incident with two entirely different versions. 

Who were these soldiers, one who &#8220;embraced martyrdom&#8221; on the other side of the fence and the Indian jawan who was &#8220;critically injured&#8221;? What is the truth? When will this stop? We will never know.
