From rediff&#8217;s article [here](http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-senes-operation-prashant-bhushan-planned-days-earlier/20111012.htm), this quote:

> &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why the president of this country, who is the supreme commander of the army, doesn&#8217;t issue orders to shoot people like Prashant Bhushan. Anyway, we, the people of this country have some responsibility and we will teach him a lesson.&#8221;

I won&#8217;t quiz you around about who said these lines: Inder Verma, 24, self-proclaimed president of the State unit of Sri Ram Sene, who attacked Prashant Bhushan in his chambers within the court premises in New Delhi, earlier today (btw, this is the same Sri Ram Sene that once beat ladies entering a pub in Mangalore). 

Apparently Mr Verma and his friends did not agree with some of the views Mr.Bhushan, a Supreme Court lawyer and a close member of the Anna Hazare group, had about Kashmir and Kashmiris. So they decided to tell a lie, gain access to his chambers in the court and beat him. Very convenient. This is a situation similar to when you and I have a disagreement on certain things. And then I decide to &#8220;teach you a lesson&#8221; &#8211; I enter your office and beat you up. If this does not enrage you, nothing will.

Anyway. These kids also threw away a bunch of pamphlets around. The last line goes:

> &#8220;Frustrated from traitors and anti-nationals and motivated from A Wednesday movie&#8221; (sic). 

I won&#8217;t say much but this is exactly the reason I have grown to loathe movies like &#8220;A Wednesday&#8221; and RDB (though elsewhere on this blog I once seemed to have an opinion that it&#8217;s a movie worthy of a watch, not anymore). In &#8220;A Wednesday&#8221;, Naseeruddin Shah&#8217;s character decides to &#8220;teach a lesson&#8221; to the Government and the Police, which includes detonating a few bombs at will. In RDB, of course, a few college kids also decide to teach the neta a lesson, the movie ending with the kids on a killing spree.

You can&#8217;t ban these movies. But the problem starts when people start taking inspiration from these flicks. Today, armed with a lie, Inder Kumar and his bunch of goons were able to access Bhushan within his office, not far away from The Supreme Court of India and Ministry of Defence. Tomorrow, they could arm themselves with a gun. 

So this culture of arbitrariness, the judgement given by a man based on his own discretion and opinion, could make the difference here. For example, well, I feel this man has an opinion that I do not much like and that he deserves a punch, so I go to his office and punch him. Another day, I may feel that his opinions deserve a bullet, so be it. 

Tehelka&#8217;s article [here](http://www.tehelka.com/story_main50.asp?filename=Ws121011Attack.asp) already mentions The Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena taking the responsibility of the attack. The group already has 4000 people associated with them on facebook. They claim, according to tehelka, that they are a group of people “who are ready to take any action” against the people it considers “anti-nationals & traitors”. 

Ready to take &#8220;any action&#8221; against the people it considers &#8220;anti-nationals & traitors&#8221;. This culture of arbitrariness. Remember Rang De Basanti?

**Update**: A google search for Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, the man who has claimed responsibility by The Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena reveals his state of mind. A few tweets from his twitter feed go by: (1) he try to break my Nation,i try to break his head.Hisab chukta. Congrats to all. operation Prashant Bhushan successfull (2)I will give my arrest tommorow.desh ko todne ki mang krne walo k sath aage bhi yhi kia jaega

Moreover, Bagga&#8217;s Google+ [profile](https://plus.google.com/115324826666197114721/about) shows him associated with the BJP youth wing. Also, he had been arrested for a day recently when he and his group had protested Arundhati Roy&#8217;s recent book launch in Delhi.
