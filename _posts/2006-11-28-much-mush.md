&#8230;But romantic neverthless. Found this poem somewhere on the internet and thought of sharing with you all here. Here goes:

> **What Matters to Me**
> 
> Time is the only healer, but I guess,
> 
> I am still to walk that road.
> 
> I still feel warm and loved I confess,
> 
> When I think about those words I wrote to you.
> 
> Yes, I do wonder what you mustâ€™ve thought,
> 
> Wonder, if you saw things from my point of view.
> 
> And I canâ€™t just keep that heart back at its place,
> 
> Or pack my bags and just walk away.
> 
> But it doesnâ€™t matter now, I am sure.
> 
> You are living your life, so lovely, so happy,
> 
> And thatâ€™s all that matters to me.
