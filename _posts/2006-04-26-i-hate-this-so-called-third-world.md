What does Preity Zinta say on The BBC? She [says](http://in.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/24inter2.htm) &#8220;India needs some simple things so that it would not remain a third-world country anymore&#8221;.  
  
Sometime in first half of the last century, someone in England came up with a term that conveniently described all the undeveloped countries. It summarised the poverty, the illiteracy, the inhumane conditions and all the bad things the west can think about into this new word and a makeshift new world, it was called &#8220;The Third World&#8221;.  
  
Our leaders chose to call it &#8220;Developing Countries&#8221;. That&#8217;s a term less harsh, but that is it.  
  
I don&#8217;t believe in this &#8220;Third World&#8221; concept. I think it was very convenient for some. It still is. But I like to think that there is no &#8220;Second&#8221; or &#8220;Third&#8221; world.  
  
There is only one World.  
  
Till the time this word is used in the context mentioned above, I must say, there remains a truth to be accepted, a reality to be braved and work to be done.  
  
You, me and Preity Zinta stay in the same world. If you accept the existence of The Third World, what is the difference then, between you and the person who invented this term?  
  
Things have to start changing first in the minds of people. People not in the west, but people right here.
