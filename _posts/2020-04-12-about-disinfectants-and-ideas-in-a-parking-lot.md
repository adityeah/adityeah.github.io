title:  "About disinfectants and ideas in a parking lot"

**NEVER** before was the list of ingredients printed on your household disinfectant been as important as it is today. Because not all disinfectants are equal. 

We need to believe that something worthwhile is being done in this lockdown, believe that we are fighting this microbe in our own small ways, so we spent a good time of the Easter weekend's Saturday, deciding if we had been wiping the freshly purchased milk containers the right way, before storing them in the fridge. The conclusion was a resounding 'NO'. 

We had been simply wiping those bottles with wipes that contained benzalkonium chloride (I swear to you, I had no idea that such a chemical was in existence, before today. I like to think myself as a person of science but I am not a chemicals person). Turns out, [benzalkonium chlroride is not effective against Coronavirus](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-household-cleaning-products-can-kill-the-virus-an-expert-on-which-ones-to-use-134301). The other conclusion of my armchair research was that as far as the Coronavirus is concerned, all roads lead to soap and water. So, we were better off wiping our groceries with soap and water and stop worrying about cleaning wipes not being available on the supermarked aisles.

The funny thing is -- we do have a 1 Litre bottle of a benzalkonium chloride, "hospital grade" disinfectant at home. We bought it last week, after seeing its shiny label beaming with confidence that it could handle 99.9% of the germs. Of course, in the present set of circumstances, it won't work.

Even hand-sanitizers are tricky business. A 60% alcohol sanitizer [won't be possibly that effective](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-not-all-hand-sanitisers-work-against-it-heres-what-you-should-use-133277) (and if you think the more alcohol the better, [100% alcohol will also backfire](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-02/coronavirus-hand-sanitiser-may-not-be-effective/12110170)). The answer is - anything around a sanitizer with 70% alcohol should be OK. But to be honest, most of the back covers of the sanitizers that I have seen so far do not mention the percentage content of alcohol. 

If one is familiar of how to make bleach work, it'd work out here. But the problem with bleach is, you really need to be sure of how to dilute it properly. As Dr Normal Swan advises on [this episode of Coronacast](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus/12134820), if detergent is there, why bother with bleach? All roads lead to soap.

**TOWARDS** the end of the day, I did find some hapiness while I went out to the shopping center to buy essentials. 

When you are inside your home, you get used to a sort of closedness, the walls of your home bounding you in. It is only when you go out after a prolonged time (something I am sure we all are doing now) and you see people, you get an idea of relativeness. Ideas such as timezones, distances, countries and residence - it all comes rushing to your head. I think, it is a reminder of the normalcy that once was. Those ideas in these times will distress you eventually, but that overwhelming moment of realisation is a good change to happen because it gives us much needed perspective. I had that realisation in the parking lot of the shopping centre today. 

Who'd have thought that one day we'd love visiting parking lots?
