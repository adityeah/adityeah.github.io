So if you have been wondering what I&#8217;ve been up to all these days, lets just say I have been taking a break. Not the &#8220;I-want-to-take-a-break-from-writing&#8221; kinds but a real break. The hectic last few days in the office followed by equally hectic travelling. A rush-rush trip to Mumbai and then to Pune (I wasn&#8217;t getting nostalgic about the city in the last post for nothing, after all) and now at home in Goa.  
  
A week off and half of it spent in travelling like mad &#8212; some of it in Mumbai&#8217;s locals that practically drain out ones stamina, in the buses, the autos and in the midst of all this, meeting friends that always complain that I am unable to take out time to meet them up.  
  
Pune has changed in bits but not changed in entirety afterall. Traffic is more than before but so are the McDonalds and the malls. This change is just about happening in every Indian city. Sadly its Pune&#8217;s turn now. Why sadly you ask. Oh, Malls aren&#8217;t the ideal things to build when the city lacks basic infrastructure and proper roads, isn&#8217;t it?  
  
Anyway, so I have been off for sometime and who knows for how much time more. Next update, probably in a few days!
