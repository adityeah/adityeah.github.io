They say it is India&#8217;s 9/11. I think I have heard that before. Maybe when they attacked the Parliament. Does it matter?

Reports like [this](http://in.rediff.com/news/2007/may/09terror.htm) come out once in a while and then are later discarded. Why?

The ATS team were interviewed by the TV last week or so. Did you know all of them were killed?

They attacked Leopold&#8217;s. Did they read Shantaram?

I was roaming on the same streets 3 days ago with a friend from far away while she absorbed everything on her first day in the city. I wanted her to have a safe journey, her first in this part of the world. Had this happened then, how safe would I have felt? How could I be my usual reassuring self?

How safe do I feel _now_?

This is Bombay, 27 November 2008. I am terrified. Petrified.
