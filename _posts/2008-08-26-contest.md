Meanwhile a bunch of interesting links that I&#8217;d like you to visit:

Caferati and livejournal have come up with a new contest. Its flash fiction. And the topic is &#8220;journal&#8221;. The end date is 7-September. Some of the prizes include serious cash, a chance to get a Livejournal paid account and a chance to see your story in print. I tell you, check this one out. [Here](http://livejournal.caferati.com/contests/quick-tales-prizes/).

Shradha visits Golkonda fort and blogs about it [here](http://shradharev.blogspot.com/2008/08/golkonda-fort.html). Picture blogging, this.

Fellow blogger Sneha has [this](http://afewstrangethings.blogspot.com/2008/08/weekend-acrylic-moods.html) acrylic work. One of the best that I have seen in recent times. 

Meanwhile, traveling in the USA, Dilip comes across what they claim to be, &#8220;The most honest place in the world&#8221;. Turns out, it might as well be. Read it [here](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/2008/08/near-fountain.html).
