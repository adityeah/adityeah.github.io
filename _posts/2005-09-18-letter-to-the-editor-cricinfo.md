The fact that I have been writing a lot about Cricket might have surprised my old readers since this is not a subject I usually mention on my blog. But frankly, the game and it&#8217;s proceedings have never been this interesting since a long, long time. So I am giving into the temptation.  
  
The Chappell-Ganguly row that has followed after the Indian Team debacle(s), what can I say, it all seems like a movie script so well written. Perfect execution by the characters involved, of course. All the experience gained in show business came in handy, afterall.  
  
_cheap rhetoric._  
  
Cricinfo has the full story [here](http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/219486.html).  
  
And my letter to the editor, Cricinfo, below.  


> Dear Editor,  
>  
> After reading CricInfo&#8217;s full story the confusion is no more and I  
> believe it is up to us, the readers, to arrive at a rational  
> conclusion.  
>  
> It&#8217;s a case of arousing sympathy. The coach was projected as the  
> villain here. If you take a closer look and think about it you will  
> see that what Chappell has done here is given it straight to Ganguly.  
> He has spoken those words to him which the media has only been  
> whispering about. Once confronted with a situation akin to a child  
> facing his strict father, Ganguly has come out complaining about it  
> expecting sympathy by projecting the coach as a villain.  
>  
> Chappell is new to this place, this whole cricket system of our  
> country. He could be given the benefit of doubt here. But Chappell or  
> no Chappell, Certainly, Ganguly is at fault. He is an experienced  
> campaigner, has lead India for 5 years now and he should know well the  
> consequences of washing dressing room&#8217;s dirty linen in public. By  
> going to the media, he has behaved like a spoiled child.  
>  
> But I wonder, if India would have been touring Australia now (and not  
> Zimbabwe or the likes) and if Ganguly would have been confronted with  
> the same situation, would he have gone to the media? Would he have  
> made a hundred in the first place?  
>  
> I doubt it.

> Good day ahead,
