For all i know, i have lived one third of my life already. And i am to spend the rest of my life with you. And yet, i do not have any idea whatsoever, of where you are. Not suprising though, that this thought hit me in the middle of a rainy night, while i lay alone, wishing that i could put things in perspective &#8211; one of them being my quest to find you. And find you i will.
