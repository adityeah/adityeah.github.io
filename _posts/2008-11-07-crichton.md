Back in 1994, in New Delhi, my imagination was stirred by a Hollywood movie that I would later go on to watch 5 more times. Jurassic Park was the first Hollywood movie I watched that I completely understood. Maybe it was so because my first viewing of the movie was in Hindi. Besides, I had never managed to watch a complete Hollywood movie before.  
  
Besides introducing a 13 year old boy to the science of cloning, it also introduced me to the rich experience of a Steven Spielberg movie and Computer Generated Imagery but the most profound and long lasting was the effect that [Michael Crichton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton) had on me. He was the author of Jurassic Park and there was a world out there to be read.  


I had just started reading [&#8220;The Three Investigators&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_investigators) and my insights into the English language and it&#8217;s literature were few. What I was not afraid of was, to pick up stuff that at first glance made little sense for someone my age. Nor was I afraid of picking books that were big in size.  
  
I made my parents buy Jurassic Park, the book. It was a costly purchase, I remember. But more importantly, it was the start of a tradition that would serve me well &#8212; to buy books that are later made into movies.  
  
I made myself a promise that from then on I would read every Michael Crichton book. I went on to read [The Terminal Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal_Man), [The Lost World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_World_(novel)), [Airframe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe_(novel)), [Timeline<a />,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_(novel)) [State of Fear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Fear) and [Prey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(novel)). I started reading [Sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(novel)) but during the course of it I once woke up to a terrifying dream. I could not complete the book. The back cover of &#8220;The Terminal Man&#8221;, the second Crichton book that I read, informed me that the author&#8217;s last name, &#8220;Crichton&#8221; rhymed with &#8220;Frighten&#8221;.  
  
As you can see, the effect of Jurassic Park, the movie and then the book, was quite strong.  
  
It has to stop now.  
  
**Michael Crichton, October 23, 1942 â€“ November 4, 2008.** You will be remembered as a writer who captivated minds. You fired my imagination.  
  
And You will be missed.
