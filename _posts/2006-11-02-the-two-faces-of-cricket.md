From a country so deprived of heroes in the recent past, from a country which has often found solace in the game of Cricket for it has been one of the few things that has gone right throughout the nations history &#8212; From Pakistan, two cricketers, one of them an idol to many and a matchwinner on his day, decide to take drugs and get [banned for a couple of years](http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/current/story/266573.html). 

And then, another man from a land already abundant in sport heroes &#8212; this man still manages to lead in his own unique way, commands respect from people in countries like India for his on and off the field activities &#8212; From Australia he comes and [builds home for the homeless in a land which is not his own](http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2006/nov/01look.htm). 

It is men like these, which eventually make good teams different from bad teams.
