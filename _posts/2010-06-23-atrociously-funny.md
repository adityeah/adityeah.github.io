First few days in a new country still and with my work, I have reached a stage where it does not matter which geographic location I am in because it is a work desk where I end up being most of the day (and night). So while I try and make it matter, here&#8217;s one message that my wife came across, in Mysore Zoo. I promise you I am not joking here but this is a message so blunt, you&#8217;d say its almost atrocious:

> &#8220;Do not stand, sit, climb or lean on zoo barriers. If you fall, animals could eat you and that might make them sick. Please co-operate.&#8221;

It ends up with a mild &#8220;Thank you&#8221; but also has a stringent warning: &#8220;Offenders will be punished&#8221;.

Tell you what, next time I visit Mysore, this is the place I want to be at.
