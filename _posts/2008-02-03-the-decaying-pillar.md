In Patna and Gaya, LLB students [go on a rampage](http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/feb/02bihar.htm) because they aren&#8217;t allowed to cheat by the authorities. Yes, it is the same [Gaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya) where, in 500 BC, Gautam Buddha attained enlightenment. After 2500 years, surely, this is some kind of enlightenment the students are looking for. It also gives you a picture of how strong this section-in-making, of one of the pillars of our democracy will turn out to be.

I think this is exactly what Shashi Tharoor meant when he mentioned in the first page of his book, &#8220;The Great Indian Novel&#8221; that &#8220;India is a highly developed country in an advanced stage of decay&#8221;.
