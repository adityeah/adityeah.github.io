I am not (yet) a fan of [Vikram Seth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Seth), simply because, and forgive me for this, I have not read his work. But yes, over the years I have seen his books in almost all the bookshops that show some interest in the prose of Indian authors. One of them, &#8220;The Suitable Boy&#8221;, is the longest novel written by an Indian (The author took a decade to write it) and according the Wikipedia, its the [7th longest novel ever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_novel). But frankly, length of any book has never impressed me &#8212; infact, to me it is of the least significance.  
  
For Indian writing, two events of prime significance happened earlier this month. Salman Rushdie&#8217;s [&#8220;Shalimar the Clown&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalimar_the_Clown) and Vikram Seth&#8217;s [&#8220;Two Lives&#8221;](http://in.rediff.com/getahead/2005/sep/15books.htm) were published. Seth&#8217;s new work almost made a silent debut amidst the fanfare Rushdie received.  
  
But now, it appears, with all the interviews that Vikram Seth has given, add to it, his sense of humor and timing, I have a feeling he would end up impressing more people than any Indian author has done so in a long, long time.  
  
The author launched his book in the 5 major cities of India. Starting from [Chennai](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/16spec1.htm) and ending it in [Delhi](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/21vicky.htm), covering [Bangalore](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/17vicky.htm), [Kolkata](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/19vicky.htm) and [Mumbai](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/19lp.htm) in between. He gave interviews and came up with interesting and funny quotes like &#8220;I&#8217;m a slow writer and I respect trees&#8221; (when asked why he spent six years writing his latest book) and, here is more, &#8220;I will pretend to read from the book for a while and you take your photos,&#8221; (when asked for a photo session) and the best quote of all, here:  
  
&#8220;what is important for a writer is when a reader is gripped by a book and delays his dinner to read a few more pages.&#8221;  
  
That is just so true.  
  
I have always believed that reading is something that helps build a better society, it is much more than just a way to ward off boredom. I hope the efforts Vikram Seth undertook will make people get up, take notice and read. We need more authors coming out, talking to people and signing autographs.  
  
We need more of this.
