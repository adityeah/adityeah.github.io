How does the state honor the [passing away of country&#8217;s greatest soldier](http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-34258120080627)?

By [declaring a state funeral.](http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200806271401.htm) 

Sounds alright. Just that the President of the Indian Republic, The Vice-President, The Prime Minister, The Defence Minister and The Three chiefs of the Armed forces [won&#8217;t be able to make it](http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jun/28kp.htm). 

Carry it on, somebody send someone to represent the absentees, won&#8217;t you? Nobody&#8217;s noticing.

Oh and in the rare case, if there is hue and cry, we can always [sign the condolence book and keep it at India gate](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Manekshaw_death_Antony_service_chiefs_face_saving_exercise/articleshow/3177765.cms). Of course, the Defence Minister and the three chiefs will sign it first!

In my opinion, this was the only profound way to _dishonor_ the passing away of India&#8217;s greatest soldier.

Is it worth it afterall, being a soldier in this country, I wonder.
