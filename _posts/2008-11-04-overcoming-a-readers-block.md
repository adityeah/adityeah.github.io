I realized I had hit a reader&#8217;s block after I read about it somewhere. I was not aware of it&#8217;s existence, let alone being in one.  
  
I read for sometime before I go to bed. At least I used to. Its another thing that my daily routine has gone for a toss since the past 6 months. Then I had time but I was not able to focus on a book for long. I had just completed Shantaram and quite honestly, the last part dragged. I was looking forward to read something else. But it persisted &#8212; I could not concentrate while reading.  
  
I&#8217;ll cut a long story short. The problem, as I found out after much thinking, was Tolstoy&#8217;s War and Peace. I had started reading it and did so with all my sincerity and thought I was doing a commendable job too. (I still think that.) But one has to admit, the first thirty pages of a book thousand pages long and written in the 19th century, won&#8217;t be, by any means, an exciting read in modern times.  
  
It was kind of okay and things were fine while I was content at flipping 2 pages (of fine print, I must mention) per session. Problems happened when I started to seek other books to read for my daily kick of &#8220;modern literature&#8221;. So everytime I read &#8220;something else&#8221;, it was as if Tolstoy was right there, staring at me, reminding me of the 1000 pages of fine print and what lay before me. It was _quite_ overwhelming. Had Aditya, the ever insightful and accurate reader, finally found a match?  
  
Okay, that last line was tongue in cheek.  
  
A phone call to a writer friend eventually helped matters. She told me that I should not think of reading Tolstoy for now. Tell you what &#8212; I had this thing in my head for long but was not being submissive about it to myself. So I said it aloud &#8212; &#8220;Its okay to have a book and not read it for years!.&#8221; The already unread books notwithstanding, I went to the bookstore and got myself a Bryson&#8217;s book. (&#8220;A Short History of Nearly Everything&#8221;, highly recommended.) Now, Bryson is easy reading and I should do well not to think of my new found urge to read as a war won but yes, for now, I do _want_ to read.  
  
Oh and how do you judge if you &#8220;want&#8221; enough? Simple. If while doing things that you normally do when you are not reading (and those must be lots) you find yourself thinking about the book; your thoughts flirting with the subject or the plot &#8212; then you should know that you are the reader every writer seeks.  
  
So, while I zip through the pages written by a new found author I intend to read _every_ book of, I must keep in mind that there are books like Garcia&#8217;s &#8220;One Hundred Years of Solitude&#8221; and Ghosh&#8217;s &#8220;The Imam and the Indian&#8221; in my bookshelf and there is much pleasure still to discover as I yearn to go to stories told by writers who have made literature such an essential part of me.  
  
No Goodbyes to all that.
