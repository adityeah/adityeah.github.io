And finally, Sonia Faleiro, makes her debut, with her novel, _The Girl_. This, I am sure, is another reason to look forward to the offerings of Modern Indian Literature.



The story is based in Goa. As I was reading the extract from the book [here](http://soniafaleiro.com/extract.htm), the words painted a picture in my mind. As far as I could make out from what I read, Sonia has brilliantly captured the standstill life of Goa. 



The prose is intense in its own way, yet captures the most important aspect of Goan life &#8211; Stillness.  
  
Please read more about the book on [Sonia&#8217;s website](http://soniafaleiro.com/). Read the [extract](http://soniafaleiro.com/extract.htm). In fact, read the book. 



 _About the Author_  
After linking to her [blog](http://soniafaleiro.blogspot.com/) and being under the impression that she is a journalist, it came as a nice but big surprise, to know that Sonia is Assistant Editor, _Tehelka_, and her non-fiction writings have appeared in _India Today_, _The Indian Express_ and _The Hindustan Times_.
