On my way back home from work, near the Sony world Koramangala intersection, I saw an Enfield Bullet with &#8220;POLITE&#8221; written on back, Red bold letters. Curiosity, like always, had the better of me and the red signal as it was, I went near the bike, dragging my (relatively) mediocre looking Honda Activa and I asked the rider what was the whole &#8220;Polite&#8221; thing all about. I mean, if these letters had to form a word on the back of an Enfield Bullet, &#8220;C&#8221; had certainly to be a part of it, instead of the &#8220;T&#8221;.  
  
Turned out, our rider had a little sense of humor. His first reaction was a frown, but as I completed my question, it turned into a smile and he told me that &#8220;POLITE&#8221;, in those big Red letters, was actually meant to scare off the rude Autorickshaw-wallas, for the menace that they have become on the roads. And since he really didn&#8217;t belong to POLICE, he could not claim that &#8220;C&#8221;. In these mad streets, at high speeds and manoeuvres , &#8220;POLITE&#8221; could well be &#8220;POLICE&#8221;.  
  
Presence of mind?

Now, I had to read this a few times to be really sure of what it was. On the exact same spot, a month or two back, a lady driven scooty with, believe it or not, a sticker that said:  
  
&#8220;DON&#8217;T KISS ME&#8221;.  
  
Oh, how could I lady, especially with that helmet you have put on.  
  
Absence of mind?
