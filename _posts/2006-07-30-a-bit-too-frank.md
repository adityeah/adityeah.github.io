Do you know what happened on 9-11-2001?  
Me:_No_

Two planes crashed on the Two towers, America

Me: _I see_

Do you know what a human bomb is? 

(I am startled but I want to continue the conversation)

Me: _No, what is it?_

It&#8217;s when a man tries to touch the feet and then presses a button and blows himself up with a bomb. Thats a human bomb. They did that to Rajiv Gandhi&#8230;

Me: _Who told you all this, beta?_

My teacher.  
  
&#8230;Conversation with my seven year old cousin, who happens to be studying in second standard (grade) in school. Is this what they ought to be learning in school, seven year old kids? Do they need to know how a human bomb works, what a human bomb is? Is it required, they know what happened on 9-11, in America? Forget 9-11, do they need to know America? Until they are not told about India, no, they do not need to know about America.  
  
And which school is this? [Frank Anthony, Bangalore](http://www.fapsbangalore.org/). A wee bit too &#8216;frank&#8217;, dont you think?
