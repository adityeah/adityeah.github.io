I will be hosting a Windows 7 launch party at my home sometime around the 22nd of October &#8211; The official launch day of Windows 7. The aim of the party is to see Windows 7 ultimate, the first day, first hand. Those of you who have had their experience with Windows 7 RC should also consider attending an event like this because there ought to be many refinements from Windows 7 RC&#8217;s journey to become the final box release.

So if you are in Bangalore around the 22nd of October and have been hoping to get your hands on Windows 7 and don&#8217;t mind coming to my place for a round of free coke and snacks with some like minded people, drop me a line on email and warm up to the idea of attending a Windows 7 Launch Party.
