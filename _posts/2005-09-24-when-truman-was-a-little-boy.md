Thanks to [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) and the satellite up above, I was _literally_ able to locate my home, the one I spent my childhood in. This was off-shore Bombay and a place so serene that you have to be a part of it to imagine it. I stayed here for 6 years and at the end of it I had travelled more on sea than land.

And of course, below is the magnificent Bombay. Seen from 22000 feet above.
