Happy Independence Day to everyone. To every Indian, and to every non-Indian who is a little bit Indian at heart.  
  
Last week on friendship&#8217;s day, I had a terrible time managing the text messages I got on my cellphone. They were so many, I simply could not keep a track of them. What interesting would be, I said to myself, the number of messages I get on Independence day. Be still my wandering mind, now I say, the number of messages throughout the day has not exceeded one. Trust me.  
  
But I insist, Happy Independence day.
