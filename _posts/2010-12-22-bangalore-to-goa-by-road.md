No, I am not going to Goa by road. Well, actually, we did that last month. But this is not a travel post (I don&#8217;t do much travel writing these days because, well, I hardly travel as much as I&#8217;d like to). 

For those who random googlers who frequently hit my blog seeking the route from Bangalore to Goa. Just a short note to post one of the conclusions of our road travel to Goa last month: Take the NH-4 (Pune-Bangalore Highway) till Hubli. Then after you have hit Hubli, take the NH-63 till Karwar. From Karwar, take the scenic and beautiful NH-17, north till you hit Goa! Best way to reach Goa from Bangalore!
