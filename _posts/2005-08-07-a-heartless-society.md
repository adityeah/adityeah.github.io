Today, while I was in the auto, on the other side of the road I saw an ambulance stuck in the middle of a traffic jam. Its red and blue bulbs flashing and the siren enveloping every other noise on the road. But it was helpless. No one bothered. Not one effort was made to give it a clear way. All the special instruments that it had equipped itself with of no use, the ambulance was just another vehicle in the thick sea of metal frames of a yet another traffic jam in this city. And for most of the drivers, I figured, with its sharp siren, it was a yet-another-nuisance.

So did the patient survive I wonder. I hope that person is still alive.

In our cars, stuck daily in the traffic jam while we go to work, we criticize the government. We demand a better civic sense not only from the government but also from the driver of the car ahead of us. We question why the roads are not wide enough. We even proudly claim that we pay our taxes and we deserve a much better city. 

But do we stop the car to let the blind man cross the road? Do we make way for the ambulance behind us? Do we, just for a second, think of the person who might be _actually_ living his last moments inside the van which is supposed to take him to the hospital? Is not that the least we can do sitting in the air conditioned interiors of our car? In those minutes while we swear countless times, is there no room for compassion at all? 

In India, life comes cheap. The economy is doing good, isn&#8217;t it? 

We are a careless, heartless society. We have grown into one.
