Chandan Mitra, editor of The Pioneer, member of the Rajya Sabha and a BJP supporter, in an interview to rediff.com [here](http://election.rediff.com/interview/2009/may/26/loksabhapoll-interview-with-chandan-mitra.htm), says, among many other things, &#8220;We failed to really reach out to the blogging community and the social networking groups&#8221;. 

Of course, there is nothing to suggest that BJP thinks that this is THE reason for losing the LS elections but what surprises me that this is even mentioned as a reason. I mean, is this guy serious? Does he actually think that influencing bloggers will help his party to an extent that he even mentions this at this stage? You don&#8217;t talk about influencing bloggers and networking groups when you end up at 120 seats. If this is the rethinking and post-poll thought process in the BJP camp, well, the less said the better.

Oh and by the way, it was BJP that had sent their &#8220;young workers&#8221; dressed in suits to various management schools across India. The idea was to, well, &#8220;reach out&#8221; to these young lads. This whole exercise was called &#8220;Advani @ Campus&#8221;. <div align = "center">\***</div> 

Varun Gandhi may have won at Pilbhit but actually BJP paid a very heavy price for it. They never condemned what he said and never fully disowned it. Instead they asked for a forensic check on the CD. All in all, what was the party&#8217;s stand on it? None. They did not know how to handle the situation. That is where they lost more votes than they gained. Now compare it to what Congress did with Sajjan Kumar and Tytler.

And does someone actually care what Advani&#8217;s personal ambitions are? By saying it repeatedly that it was his heart&#8217;s desire to become the PM, he gave an impression that he is bigger than the party. I think this is a problem with BJP &#8212; they have always portrayed individuals bigger than the party or the ideologies they stand for. And while we are talking about ideologies, one should remember that BJP has been facing a never ending dilemma of how much degree of Hindutva they should toy with. 

Meanwhile, I wait for the day when our politics rises above all this. For all its worth, it&#8217;s really disappointing.
