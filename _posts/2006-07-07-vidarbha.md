More than a thousand farmers have commited suicide in Vidarbha, in the past 4 years or so.  
  
Yet, no Sharad Pawar and no Vilasrao Deshmukh even bothered to visit the place. And mind you, its not a place far, far away. It&#8217;s their own state.  
  
These politicians, they have no conscience. The plight of the farmers remains the same. The politicians can&#8217;t claim they have spent the money on the Urban development, for Mumbai stands the same, year after year, half sunk in the rains.  
  
And yet, it took 3 years for our PM to visit Vidarbha. People are dying there.  
  
Do you know, PM sa&#8217;ab, what the heat of the Vidarbha summer is like?  
  
You talk about the booming economy and the growth rate, but it takes a farmer to tell you that [70% of India&#8217;s population can&#8217;t afford to buy two meals a day. A girl, in school, tells you that she doesn&#8217;t want to marry a farmer.](http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/jul/06slide5.htm)
