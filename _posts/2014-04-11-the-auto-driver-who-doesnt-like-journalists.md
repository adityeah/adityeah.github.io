Last Saturday I went to the other side of town, to Malleswaram. On the way back I could not find a bus so I had to take an auto. I live in south Bangalore and the distance is quite a lot. It was a long way home and as it happens under such circumstances, almost inevitably, the auto driver and I got talking.

The election fever has overtaken us all and so I asked him if he would vote. Yes, he said. We got talking about political affiliations. To my surprise, he said he would vote for the AAP. As I recall, I think he got Kejriwal&#8217;s name wrong (I think he said &#8220;Aggarwal&#8221; &#8211; but that is beyond the point because he was aware of what had happened in Delhi). We, the urban elite, have always thought of AAP as a mostly urban-upper-middle-class phenomenon so that conversation was a myth-buster.

Anyway, towards the end of the ride, the driver mentioned that he was cautious about opening up with his passengers these days. Considering that we had just had a long conversation, I found it a bit odd so I asked him why. The other day, he recalled, an incident happened when he dropped a lady at Malleswaram. I asked him further. &#8220;Well&#8221;, he said, &#8220;she got talking just like you. About life, social issues, politics etc. And when she got down, she asked me if she could take my picture. I was hesitant but she took one and left&#8221;. 

The lady was a journalist. The auto driver claimed that she asked him questions, got him talking and recorded the conversation without telling him about it. A few days later (or the next day, I do not know) an article was published with his name (and he claimed it carried his picture too) in Bangalore&#8217;s Deccan Herald. &#8220;My friends saw it and they were laughing at me. I kept telling them &#8211; I never said all that&#8221;.

I told him, in a way that he could understand, that for a journalist to do that was wrong. He didn&#8217;t need much convincing &#8211; he already knew that. More than the quotes, which he said weren&#8217;t true anyway, he was hurt by the fact that his name was published in a newspaper without his consent. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to do anything about it&#8221;. I told him that I can take this up with Deccan Herald. He agreed but later he added, &#8220;Sir, I just don&#8217;t want my name anywhere&#8221;.

I went home and searched for his name at Deccan Herald&#8217;s website. I found him quoted in a story, just as he had mentioned. I did not find his picture there (thus, I can&#8217;t say if Deccan Herald carried it in the print version).

The next day, I posted a series of tweets &#8211; some of them mentioned his name and the link to the article. I was wrong to do that &#8211; in my bid to highlight the lapse of ethos, I committed the same mistake I accuse Deccan Herald of &#8211; quoting the auto driver despite his reluctance. Moments later, I deleted those tweets. I have taken care not to mention his name and the article link on this post.

What I did was though was this: I tried to contact the author of the article on twitter. I haven&#8217;t heard from her. Maybe I will. I also tagged Deccan Herald&#8217;s twitter account on my tweets about it (those tweets that I decided to keep) and somewhat conveniently, I haven&#8217;t heard back from them.

Apart from the obvious lack of ethos evident here, my only question is this &#8212; would this journalist dare do the same thing if she met, say, a CEO of a company? Or anyone who held more influence than our auto driver? Someone who won&#8217;t be as helpless and won&#8217;t hesitate to go public about it? Would she record the conversation without telling, snap a picture when done and then run the story despite knowing that it is not OK to do it? 

Because out there, an auto driver doesn&#8217;t want to ever talk to journalists.
