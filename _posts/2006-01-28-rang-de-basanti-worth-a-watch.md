**NO Plot/Story Spoiler ahead, so read ahead, don&#8217;t worry** :)  
  
I watched the movie, first day, second show at Goa&#8217;s Inox multiplex. Rang De Basanti (the title of the movie name constantly reminds me of the Radiocity Bangalore DJ, Basanthi),like the other, new-generation, &#8220;good&#8221; movies carries most of those attributes that one relates the modern times with &#8212; Slick photography, Brilliant cinematography and camerawork with awesome music score (well, most of it) but lacks where it matters &#8212; The story.  
  
I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up with these new-age directors. Screenplay, music, camerawork, all top class. They can make anything look so good! If you consider movies like Swades, Paheli and now, Rang de Basanti, you will see that how much they have stressed on India, it&#8217;s values, it&#8217;s people, the culture. Just when we thought that the focus had almost entirely shifted on urban India, we see the Indian countryside and the villages and they look refreshed like never before. Colorful, full of energy. And suddenly you want to be there. The next coming weekend, you want to explore the outskirts of the city, maybe go on the highway, find a _dhaba_ and eat lunch.  
  
But then where do movies like these go wrong? They mess up with something very basic. Most of the times, the casualty is the storyline. Making everything look beautiful and modern, they try a little too hard and in the process, go off the basics of movie making. It&#8217;s like eating _special bhelpuri_ with almost no salt. Get what I mean? Rang de Basanti (RDB) is no different. But then again, it&#8217;s not at all bad.  
  
It is clear that the makers of RDB want to give a message to the youth, in the youth&#8217;s own language, own _style_. In that sense, I thought it is very similar to Maniratnam&#8217;s Yuva. I thought RDB falters because the message to attain a purpose is given alright, but the means to achieve that purpose is wrong. A few more details, and I would be spoiling your movie, so I stop here :)  
  
Final verdict: Even though most of the story actually _happens_ post intermission, it&#8217;s a movie to watch. It has got enough positives to buy a ticket and watch it in the theatre (with Dolby!). AR Rehman&#8217;s music adds a whole perspective in itself. And one more thing &#8212; The perfomances by the actors are worth not just to be seen, but _experienced_. (Another complaint though, I thought the much acclaimed, Atul Kulkarni could have done with a more demanding role. He is such a delight to watch and he makes most of the screentime that he gets). RDB is not a &#8220;just-Amir-Khan-all-the-way&#8221; movie. Watch it.
