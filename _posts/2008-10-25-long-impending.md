Since I have been spending 15 hour days (or nights) at office for the past month, it was, sort of, impending I post at an unearthly hour and that too from my office. It was sort of impending, that I write about my personal experiences lately &#8212; something that I usually do not like to but then again, my &#8220;intellectual curiosity&#8221; and everything else that makes me think (&#8230;think some more and then write) has lately been thrown out of the window. So here I am now, 2 AM, on my work desk at office, waiting for the cab to arrive while I listen to U2&#8217;s &#8220;Even better than the real thing&#8221; and write these, mostly and quite literally, senseless words.  
  
Oh well, just when I had thought I will blabber on, my cab has saved you from the rhetoric.  
  
This has been, again, impending.
