I have been published by The Caravan Magazine. This month&#8217;s (February 2012) issue carries an article that I wrote for them. It&#8217;s a story about four guys, security guards in Bangalore&#8217;s Domlur area, who ferry passengers from one side of the road to another. I called the article, &#8220;The Traffic Slowers&#8221;, while Caravan preferred to name it, &#8220;At Their Own Risk&#8221;. No, I am not complaining.

You can check out the article [here](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/Story/1263/At-Their-Own-Risk.html), at Caravan&#8217;s website.

It was a wonderful experience working with the people at Caravan. As an aspiring writer, this experience means a lot to me. Going around city, making notes, reworking my prose that could fit in Caravan&#8217;s style&#8230;

My sincere thanks to those at Caravan who I worked with. They know who they are. I hope you do read and enjoy my story, story of Das, Rajvir, Mohanty and Ranganatha&#8217;s, as much as I did while writing it.
