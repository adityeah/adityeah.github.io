An essay I wrote about a conversation I had, 10 years ago one night in Pune and the connection it has with my trip to USA that happened last year, has been published by Tehelka Magazine in their latest issue (Jan 22, 2011). This is perhaps my first intended publication in mainstream media and I am glad that it happened. Here is the [link](http://tehelka.com/story_main48.asp?filename=hub220111personal.asp) to it, valid for at least a week, on tehelka&#8217;s website. 

I would have called it &#8220;Scales of success&#8221;. 

Many thanks to those who have made this possible. They know who they are.

Soon, I&#8217;ll be posting the original, unabridged essay on my website.
