I have been travelling, this past weekend. Not many places though, touched Mangalore, visited Udupi for a day and 2 days at home in Goa. The Bus and train journeys take the toll but I must say, there is absolutely nothing like travelling in small-town South India. If you like travelling and haven&#8217;t yet tasted this experience, you have missed so much!

Besides, this could be the best time for travelling in the small cities of South India. This time, when the small-towns are still &#8220;small&#8221;, still are able to defy the heavy commercialisation. So, if not now, then when?

Will write more once I am back in Bangalore tomorrow.
