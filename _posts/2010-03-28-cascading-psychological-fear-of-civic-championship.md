One of the candidates for the BBMP election to be held today &#8212; I won&#8217;t name her, sent leaflets to her prospective voters through newspapers. One such leaflet made its way to me. While I must insist **that the Candidate&#8217;s usage of English grammar (or the lack of it) should have nothing to do with deciding who to vote for**, I am still reproducing here the contents of the leaflet, as is:
