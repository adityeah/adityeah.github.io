In the last 6 years, a critically acclaimed actor (who is a khan too), an actor who is a Punjabi and a Hindu, the other two &#8220;bankable&#8221; khans of the Indian film industry, a model-turned-actor (a Christian) and a former, and arguably the most respected, President of India, were all frisked at US Airports by Homeland security.

Still, one so called King Khan chose to make a huge hue and cry about it. On top of it, the man says SRK does not need publicity. Also note that he introduced himself as a movie &#8220;star&#8221;.

Shahrukh Khan is one arrogant man.
